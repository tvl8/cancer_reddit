"Ohmygosh you poor darling.

Bear in mind that your Mum may be feeling a lot of complex emotions right now.  Her mind will possibly change a few times, but she wants the right to reserve a dignified goodbye to the world.

She will be very concerned about being a burden to you.  Please, please get in touch with Cancer organisations to give you both the best advice and care.  

The hospital or doctors, or even your church can put you in touch with the right assistance.  Even Rotary, Freemason's or Lions Club might be helpful.  Don't be afraid to be frank and explain to them what you have written here about the circumstances.

For example, in my town in NSW, a church has small but nice accommodation, near a pretty park in a lovely suburb for end of life care, for people of their faith.

There's aspects of her care that will be specifically related to the cancer she's experiencing, as well. Again a Stomach Cancer specific organisation may help you to stock up on items she might need.",0,1719813592,CancerFamilySupport
"I'll go to the ER at literally the first sign of infection. I'm well versed in regular wound care and infection. But the simple fact is that I do not have the option to see a physician sooner than Monday the 8^(th), and this is not something I trust to some rando PA. Last time I was in an urgent care with a PA, the dude didn't know the difference between tramadol and toradol. And I am not putting off a non-routine cancer screening over a leg.

"Hello! 22f here. I went through almost the same thing you’re going through now. No symptoms, found a lump in my neck, went through a bunch of doctors, got an ultrasound, had a lot of nodules throughout my thyroid, had multiple biopsy’s. Was absolutely devastated by the diagnosis. Also Bethesda category VI. Was also told I have the BRAF mutation, which made my cancer a more aggressive type. I am now 1 month post TT, and I feel amazing ALL THE TIME. Granted, this is my experience. I go for my radiation treatment at the end of the month. I say all this to say, things get better. I cried for a week, was questioning what will happen since I found out in the middle of my first nursing program semester.

My surgeon and my oncologist both say that I am set to live a very long and healthy life. This is a very treatable cancer that has a lot of research showing that it is not fatal in most cases. I’ve also been told that this will not affect my fertility and I still have plenty of opportunities to have children. Again, I say all of this to say that things do in fact get better. Good luck hun <3",0,1719824129,thyroidcancer

"I do understand why you feel this way.  They type of health insurance I have resulted in me having several different doctors during my pregnancy. I had a regular Dr who I saw most but one time she was unavailable and I had to see a man. I forget the substance of that appointment but I do remember it being one of my best pregnancy appointments. Additionally a male delivered my baby as he was the MD on shift when it was my turn to deliver. That man saved my baby and I from having a c-section and I am so grateful for him.  Additionally to that a man placed my IUD. He was fast professional and kind.  I have only had great experiences with my male MD's. One last thing, my urologist (diagnosed with bladder cancer during that pregnancy) is a man and he is great. I thought I preferred female  MDs but my experience has showed me that men are fully capable and equally compassionate when treating women.",0,1719807660,WomensHealth
"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it. 

I don't know if anything I said was really helpful, but I hope it was. I'm sending you and your wife a ton of love right now and hoping this particular issue will become less important as she heals from the surgery and the pain subsides.",0,1719808898,breastcancer

"I went to one recently after my neurologist said something more was up. I brought a list of everything I've been feeling, even the small stuff like weird nail changes and a pre-cancer diagnosis. She did a full body exam, pressed on all my joints and then told me that I'm a little more flexible then most people and that's probably causing my pain. She said there is nothing she could do and that unless I was feeling pain in all of my joints all over then not to come back. I told her I was frustrated and she said she has prescribed medication before but it doesn't do anything for people like me. She said she would order labs for RA but not to expect anything and even if it was positive then she can't do anything because it's too early, she said to let the labs expire if I felt like it.

  
Well, I took the labs a few weeks later and I had a positive HlA-B27 and found out of a family history of psoriatic arthritis. She called when she got the results and said, actually, I need to see you by Friday and I need to see you every 6 months for the foreseeable future. She didn't want to give me any medication unless I told her I had been having pain for a decade, I have been having unexplained pain for at least that long or longer so she put me on Prednisone. I felt like I needed to argue for it but she did listen to me. I felt so much better after a week that she put me on Sulfasalazine and I'm waiting to see the effects.

  
I would ask for labs, maybe for the HLA gene and see where it goes. We are young, I'm just 29 but it's taken years of arguing to get someone to listen. It really wasn't until my neurologist reassured me that doctors will ignore me and to keep at it, that I put my thoughts of being an annoying patient aside and to keep at it that I actually got results. Maybe you don't have an autoimmune disease but that doesn't mean your experiences aren't valid and you don't need assistance.",0,1719810959,Autoimmune
"All the treatments have negative effects and make no mistake, it may not kill you if you catch it and treat it early, but prostate cancer still really sucks. As for choosing RALP, no way I wanted the chemical castration shots that go with radiation, and besides that radiation also can lead to incontinence and ED like RALP, as well as bowel problems that don’t seem to affect those who choose surgery. From what I have come to understand you experience the surgical side effects but things get better, with radiation the effects come later but you do you not bounce back. Every person is different and every case is different so I would talk to as many people and do as much research as you can. What was right for me may not be right for you.

My sister is a physician and she recommended the nerve-sparing RALP before I even saw my urologist for the biopsy, just in case it was positive. My incontinence lasted about 72 hours after the catheter was out and was very minor. ED is a work in progress. I am barely 5 months out and I was told it takes some time to fully recover from ED, many of the others who chose RALP have told their stories. Even if erections do not fully return there are shots like trimix and bimix, vacuum devices, implants etc. My surgeon uses a nerve monitoring device and he said everything checked out before and after the surgery, and he is very positive about my making a full recovery in every respect. 

Both radiation and RALP have their proponents in the medical field in on this board, you have to talk to your doctors, do your research and choose what is best for you. If I was older I probably would have gone the radiation route but I also like the idea of being able to do radiation if I ever have a biochemical recurrence. If you do radiation first it’s hard to do surgery later because of the tissue damage. It was also a relief to get the prostate out and get good pathology, which confirmed it was all contained, it was all Gleason 3+4 and nothing on the capsule, clean margins all around. So avoiding the chemical castration shot, as well as getting pathology on the gland that took away a lot of my anxiety made surgery well worth it to me. I would do it again.",0,1719811622,ProstateCancer
"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

Do that. 

Follow their recommendations to the letter!

"I, 23M, went through one two months ago, and to add to it I went out to cheer up, got food poisoning and the doctors mistook it for signs of colon cancer, did a colonoscopy, took a biopsy, and at that point I just said ok im dead. 

It was just food poisoning with an infection that escalated, and that’s just life.

In my gap year…

I applied to 4 jobs - all want experience. 

I opened a business - failed due to a dying market. 
studied for my dat, and then postponed it to save up more money for the test and apps that I could barely afford. And now I’m reviewing again because I forgot a lot of it. I still have the DAT to take this month. 

My hobbies? Hobbies are just making money.

Friends? I don’t talk to most of my friends cause I avoid “how are your applications going” “did you take the DAT” “wow, just don’t be lazy”. I homestead a party yesterday and they commented “so you’re not taking your test this year”, I kicked them out but they took it as a joke.

BUT, I’ve come to realize this is all apart of the journey. Every dental/med student goes through the same steps to reach dental school. That’s not on us, it’s on the US system. Other countries have their students graduating dental school at 23/24. ITS A 5 YEAR PROGRAM!

"What happened to me is the endometrial was diagnosed first, low grade stage 1a, so they told me to keep ovaries since I was not in menopause. Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now. I do have lung nodules, but they are not believed to be metastatic. It's really all a guessing game of anxiety, isn't it.",0,1719849610,endometrialcancer

Where I’m from, CTs are used for emergencies and avoided religiously for young people, especially women due to the radiation. After that CT, I’ve had very regular MRIs, I was also told it’s better to see tissue and cancers opposed to a CT.

"Also, I have heard of people not being diagnosed with graves or hyperthyroidism in youth and later developing hashimoto's that can swing between hyper and hypo. Usually, they recommend nuking your thyroid, but 2 people I know did it for that reason regret it. Doctors suspect I was hyper well before being hypo. I'm only 5'2"", but my normal weight was 95-100 lbs max. But I didn't look too skinny because I was able to gain muscle. After 2 kids, my normal weight eating whatever I felt like did change to 110-115. Unfortunately, I had all the hypo symptoms except weight gain. High tsh and antibodies, extreme exhaustion, and bad insomnia, but also very low cortisol. They suspected Addisons disease and did after every possible test, including radioactive iodine. They concluded I didn't have Addisons disease. Shortly after the radioactive iodine, my thyroid swelled to the size of a softball, and then they thought it was cancer 🙄 Basically all the crap they did just made my thyroid worse and then I started gaining weight.

"Support from people I didn’t expect it from, which makes me rethink how I handle things when I hear someone else is going through a difficult situation.

Weirdly, my most helpful support came from someone I barely knew personally. A teacher, who I had to inform about surgery/chemo, due to impact on classes. She was fully curious about it all, asked a million questions and gave me someone to talk to without complicating a relationship.

"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

"Choosing not to have treatment is a valid choice. It’s an extreme choice with extreme consequences though, and I think it warrants thorough discussion. 

For a lot of people with stage four cancer, probably for most of us, we will never be cured. But we can be treated and we might be here for years. Cancer can be, but that doesn’t mean it’s untreatable. 

I know that small lung cancer is a particularly brutal type of cancer and I’m sure that is a factor in your decision.

My advice is to get a referral to a palliative care doctor that is associated with your cancer center or hospital. This is a doctor that focuses on quality of life and they can help you understand what your life could be like if you underwent treatment and the possible time you could get from treatment. And they should also be able to talk to you about what will happen if you choose not to have treatment and how your disease will progress. And what can be done to keep you comfortable during that time.

They could talk to you about what time would be like when you are receiving hospice care. What are your options and where will you receive care and who would your primary caretakers be? These are all things that you need to think about if you choose not to have treatment.

Talk to the people closest to you, the ones you think can handle this discussion because not everybody can. Ultimately, it’s your decision, but it’s a such an important decision that it deserves a lot of conversation and a lot of thought and input from people who love you and input from doctors that deal with these types of decisions every day.",0,1719844160,cancer

I wear a mask if I have to go somewhere crowded. However, I tend to stay away from grocery stores, Walmarts, etc right now. My doctors told me to be smart and stay away from small children as well 🤣

I think you have to do what you’re comfortable with and what your doctors are comfortable with. Chemo and cancer doesn’t have to be totally isolating!",0,1719844454,lymphoma

"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can’t find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

"Alternative therapies are suicide.

I got diagnosed with CLL in 2015. I'm still alive. Why? Because I took the advice of real doctors and not morons on the Internet.

I had MAB and venotoclax  treatment in 2021. Stopped the cancer for the moment.

Anybody who has this condition needs legit medical advice based on genetic testing.",0,1719829111,cll
"By no means am I a doctor & I don’t have children, so your symptoms may be related to that.  I had inverted nipple, along with hard, orange peeling skin, to side & a little underneath nipple.  My gut feeling was I had cancer.  So many times, I’d ignored those feelings & EVERY feeling was, later, proven right.  So I trusted it this time. 
Also, I researched, before I could see GYN, (had already made appt. Was just waiting for the day) & those 2 signs pointed to definite cancer.  Which I do have cancer.  I’m, very much, hoping that u do not have cancer & that whatever it is, is treatable. 
Now, in 2006, I had found a lump, right breast. Cancer is in left.  GYN didn’t seem too concerned, so she started by prescribing antibiotics & lump went away.  Never came back. Can’t remember what she diagnosed it as that she started with antibiotics.  So I’m hoping it’s that easy of a fix for u!  🤗🤗💜💜💜",0,1719830928,doihavebreastcancer
"I don't know if this helps. But now is the best time to have cancer. What I would recommend is trusting the doctor's advice. They know what's best. And I would prepare for when the tumor reoccurs. There's a great website where you can see all the clinical trials that are happening in the country at clinicaltrials.gov. There's a lot of clinical trials that have great results right now. I was diagnosed with an astrocytoma in November and what I can say is that it is a very, very stressful process. I can't imagine what it is like to have a child go through that. But there is hope.",0,1719831260,braincancer

"HI, From my experience, this is an emotional rollercoaster. After talking with some Doctors and doing research, My thought now is,  that this is a condition I need to deal with. It is not a death sentence. there is time.  While Gleason 9 is aggressive. I am still told I have 6 months or more to decide on a treatment plan. The goal to get cancer free is obtainable. I basically have 2 options as active surveillance is off the table. I can do surgery to have the prostate removed? or have radiation treatment to have the cancer cells killed. Since your dad has it in his lymph nodes, Surgery may not be the best option but that's for a DR to discuss.  The radiation is where I am looking but even there, there seems to be a dozen treatment types.  I think the goal for me it to determine which is the best type of treatment with the least side effects. That's my Challenge.  Hang in there, I'm sure your dad is just trying to protect you by not discussing it. But keep talking to him. I've learned the more I discuss it, the better I feel about going through this. I'm sure he will open up when he is ready. and give him a big Hug.......",0,1719837484,ProstateCancer
