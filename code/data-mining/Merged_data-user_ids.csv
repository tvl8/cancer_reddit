WeakGhost,"That last line about seeing a colourful bird just got me ♥️ My Dad has been struggling through bladder cancer for two years now and his prognosis just gets bleaker. He was with a medical team in Toronto who sat on his cancer recurrence and instead of treatment just ordered rounds of tests for 4 months. The cancer has now spread, he’s with another team at a different hospital, but his physical and mental health are suffering and it feels like he’s giving up. My heart truly goes out to you and everything you’ve been through the frustration of having to push for treatment and to advocate for the people you love is so hard.",1719846063,BladderCancer
zombieus1,"You are not alone... I am a 22y/o and I had my surgery in January...now finding out I may have lung involvement after RAI... I thought I was done and things were starting to clear up but they're not. So much waiting and struggle. I've had the same experience as you with people saying I'm lucky to have had thyroid cancer as opposed to other cancers but they just don't get it. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and stressed and scared. Just because thyroid cancer has a good prognosis doesn't mean it's less hard to go through.

Everything has been fine with my medication but I still understand what you feel. For my situation, I feel the same frustration with not being able to move on with my life, but for me it's from this new possible lung spread. You're not alone. You are valid. You are strong.

3DFarmer,"I went to one recently after my neurologist said something more was up. I brought a list of everything I've been feeling, even the small stuff like weird nail changes and a pre-cancer diagnosis. She did a full body exam, pressed on all my joints and then told me that I'm a little more flexible then most people and that's probably causing my pain. She said there is nothing she could do and that unless I was feeling pain in all of my joints all over then not to come back. I told her I was frustrated and she said she has prescribed medication before but it doesn't do anything for people like me. She said she would order labs for RA but not to expect anything and even if it was positive then she can't do anything because it's too early, she said to let the labs expire if I felt like it.

  
Well, I took the labs a few weeks later and I had a positive HlA-B27 and found out of a family history of psoriatic arthritis. She called when she got the results and said, actually, I need to see you by Friday and I need to see you every 6 months for the foreseeable future. She didn't want to give me any medication unless I told her I had been having pain for a decade, I have been having unexplained pain for at least that long or longer so she put me on Prednisone. I felt like I needed to argue for it but she did listen to me. I felt so much better after a week that she put me on Sulfasalazine and I'm waiting to see the effects.

  
I would ask for labs, maybe for the HLA gene and see where it goes. We are young, I'm just 29 but it's taken years of arguing to get someone to listen.

Bored_AF18,"thank you for pointing out how it’s misunderstood. people constantly tell me “at least it’s not a terminal illness like cancer” or “they could’ve caught it later” and it’s not helpful. it just hurts because i feel like im overreacting bc my symptoms aren’t as bad right now or the condition itself isn’t going to kill me. i have been back to my normal self while on prednisone (about to start remicade finally) but when i have cramps or even have to go to the bathroom people think i’m having a full flare or are like “o thought you were fine? you were fine earlier”. it’s so frustrating not being able to express how it takes a toll on you physically and mentally, even when you’re feeling alright",1719799836,CrohnsDisease
Quirky-Sun762,"It made me realise exactly how little I had. And it’s impacted my relationship to the point it’s now in tatters and I’m not sure it can be salvaged. My partner had to manage his own health, which he then neglected and told me he did so so I could have cancer treatment. Meanwhile I then had to manage his emotions all the time and I could only express myself how he wanted. If I expressed myself in a way he didn’t like, I got shut down. Which, at times I needed, because I was taking it out on him. Other times, he was the reason I was frustrated and I couldn’t express it without being invalidated.

The only family member that really came through for me was my brother but even then, the actual emotional support was curbed in the only way my brother knew how to cope. My mom has been a huge disappointment but that’s not surprising. 

I no longer have the patience for people who won’t just communicate with me. Sometimes people want you to dig into them and draw the information out and I used to have the patience but not anymore. I cannot manage anyone else’s emotions anymore. I’ve become impatient. Irritable. Mean. But I’ve also become less of a people pleaser. I assert more boundaries. I am not everyone’s security blanket/bank/mother/whatever else.

What did surprise me were the one or two people who emerged out of the woodwork and proved to be friends I didn’t realise I had. No one ever visited me or anything but there were people who reached out that I never thought would. And the people I thought would reach out never did. Life is a funny one.",1719847236,breastcancer

I had a regular Dr who I saw most but one time she was unavailable and I had to see a man. I forget the substance of that appointment but I do remember it being one of my best pregnancy appointments. Additionally a male delivered my baby as he was the MD on shift when it was my turn to deliver. That man saved my baby and I from having a c-section and I am so grateful for him.  Additionally to that a man placed my IUD. He was fast professional and kind.  I have only had great experiences with my male MD's. One last thing, my urologist (diagnosed with bladder cancer during that pregnancy) is a man and he is great.

allemm,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it. 

I don't know if anything I said was really helpful, but I hope it was. I'm sending you and your wife a ton of love right now and hoping this particular issue will become less important as she heals from the surgery and the pain subsides.",1719808898,breastcancer

Professor_Eindackel,"All the treatments have negative effects and make no mistake, it may not kill you if you catch it and treat it early, but prostate cancer still really sucks. As for choosing RALP, no way I wanted the chemical castration shots that go with radiation, and besides that radiation also can lead to incontinence and ED like RALP, as well as bowel problems that don’t seem to affect those who choose surgery. From what I have come to understand you experience the surgical side effects but things get better, with radiation the effects come later but you do you not bounce back. Every person is different and every case is different so I would talk to as many people and do as much research as you can. What was right for me may not be right for you.

My sister is a physician and she recommended the nerve-sparing RALP before I even saw my urologist for the biopsy, just in case it was positive. My incontinence lasted about 72 hours after the catheter was out and was very minor. ED is a work in progress. I am barely 5 months out and I was told it takes some time to fully recover from ED, many of the others who chose RALP have told their stories. Even if erections do not fully return there are shots like trimix and bimix, vacuum devices, implants etc. My surgeon uses a nerve monitoring device and he said everything checked out before and after the surgery, and he is very positive about my making a full recovery in every respect. 

Both radiation and RALP have their proponents in the medical field in on this board, you have to talk to your doctors, do your research and choose what is best for you. If I was older I probably would have gone the radiation route but I also like the idea of being able to do radiation if I ever have a biochemical recurrence. If you do radiation first it’s hard to do surgery later because of the tissue damage. It was also a relief to get the prostate out and get good pathology, which confirmed it was all contained, it was all Gleason 3+4 and nothing on the capsule, clean margins all around. So avoiding the chemical castration shot, as well as getting pathology on the gland that took away a lot of my anxiety made surgery well worth it to me. I would do it again.",1719811622,ProstateCancer

QHS_1111,"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

speakbela,"I had 8 chemos, 4 AC and 4 double dose T. My veins collapsed after the 3rd chemo and for some reason my doctor said I still didn’t need a port.

After chemo I had a right breast mastectomy with 13 lymph nodes taken in addition to the whole axillary dissection. So! Now I can’t have any needles or BP taken on my right, and I have lymphedema now! Ugh.  So all this to say, if I had a port, maybe my veins wouldn’t have collapsed and maybe my chemos would’ve been a bit easier as opposed to the nightmare of having 17 different nurses trying to start a line every time with my paper thin veins. I used to be a great stick too. Now I have the worst needle anxiety because most of the time people can’t access the veins on my left side unless they are really really good with cancer patients or little kids.  If I need bloodwork done for anything now I call my sister and bff who are both nurse managers (different fields, MS and surgical ICU) because they themselves hired their team so I get their top notch phlebotomist, and because all my doctors are in the same network (Hackensack) they all have access to the portal.

For a lot of people with stage four cancer, probably for most of us, we will never be cured. But we can be treated and we might be here for years. Cancer can be, but that doesn’t mean it’s untreatable. 

I know that small lung cancer is a particularly brutal type of cancer and I’m sure that is a factor in your decision.

My advice is to get a referral to a palliative care doctor that is associated with your cancer center or hospital. This is a doctor that focuses on quality of life and they can help you understand what your life could be like if you underwent treatment and the possible time you could get from treatment. And they should also be able to talk to you about what will happen if you choose not to have treatment and how your disease will progress. And what can be done to keep you comfortable during that time.

They could talk to you about what time would be like when you are receiving hospice care. What are your options and where will you receive care and who would your primary caretakers be? These are all things that you need to think about if you choose not to have treatment.

Talk to the people closest to you, the ones you think can handle this discussion because not everybody can. Ultimately, it’s your decision, but it’s a such an important decision that it deserves a lot of conversation and a lot of thought and input from people who love you and input from doctors that deal with these types of decisions every day.",1719844160,cancer

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Friends? I don’t talk to most of my friends cause I avoid “how are your applications going” “did you take the DAT” “wow, just don’t be lazy”. I homestead a party yesterday and they commented “so you’re not taking your test this year”, I kicked them out but they took it as a joke.

BUT, I’ve come to realize this is all apart of the journey. Every dental/med student goes through the same steps to reach dental school. That’s not on us, it’s on the US system. Other countries have their students graduating dental school at 23/24. ITS A 5 YEAR PROGRAM!

createhomelife,"What happened to me is the endometrial was diagnosed first, low grade stage 1a, so they told me to keep ovaries since I was not in menopause. Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now. I do have lung nodules, but they are not believed to be metastatic. It's really all a guessing game of anxiety, isn't it.",1719849610,endometrialcancer

And boy, the ER doctors argued for almost 2h with the radiologist to get me into that machine. Where I’m from, CTs are used for emergencies and avoided religiously for young people, especially women due to the radiation. After that CT, I’ve had very regular MRIs, I was also told it’s better to see tissue and cancers opposed to a CT.

Defiant_Brother_1172,"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can’t find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

It is not a death sentence. there is time.  While Gleason 9 is aggressive. I am still told I have 6 months or more to decide on a treatment plan. The goal to get cancer free is obtainable. I basically have 2 options as active surveillance is off the table. I can do surgery to have the prostate removed? or have radiation treatment to have the cancer cells killed. Since your dad has it in his lymph nodes, Surgery may not be the best option but that's for a DR to discuss.  The radiation is where I am looking but even there, there seems to be a dozen treatment types.  I think the goal for me it to determine which is the best type of treatment with the least side effects. That's my Challenge.  Hang in there, I'm sure your dad is just trying to protect you by not discussing it. But keep talking to him. I've learned the more I discuss it, the better I feel about going through this.

Chikorita_banana,"It can be inherited but can also occur as a random mutation. LS can be caused by a single nucleotide change/mutation, and there are several factors that could promote the occurrence of a mutation like that (e.g., environmental exposures, random chance).

We also have to consider that recordkeeping in terms of cancer identification, diagnosis, treatment, and cause of mortality are also fairly recent in human history; I'm 34 and I really only have reliable family history data to look at back to the later years of my grandparents. If they didn't tell me about any cancers they had earlier in their lives, it's unlikely that I would be able to find out about them.

So if you don't have a history of a certain type of cancer that women get in your family, it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't or won't occur! It's possible that it was passed down from your father, that it was obscured in past recordkeeping practices, or that people have just gotten lucky in terms of MSH6 cancers in your family!

MSH6 also seems to be one of the ""less bad"" types of LS, with lower overall risks of cancers relative to MSH2 and other types of LS (but still greater, and for certain cancers significantly greater, than the risk for someone without LS). I inherited MSH6 from my mom, and we think we inherited it from her father who died of brain cancer at 72 (but had not had cancer prior to that). Our extended family members took tests as well, and maternal grandfather's sister found out she has MSH6 too. Her first cancer was found when she was in her 80s! But meanwhile my mom (66) has been one of the not-so-lucky people with MSH6, and is currently recovering from her 4th cancer.

susevda,"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

Mine was under the impression that it was ""just a colon cancer thing"" and refused to text me after I learned it was in my family. Because I was old enough that ""It wouldn't change the screening recommendations anyway""

And that's where it sat for 5 years until I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. I pushed for testing again, and mentioned that Lynch was probably responsible, he told me I was wrong about Lynch! I was stunned. Asked him to look it up on UpToDate (basically a medical encyclopedia for medical people to access during work - I work at a hospital that uses it so I'm familiar with it) and he did, during our visit. Apologized and said he'd learn more about Lynch before our next visit.

I then talked with the husband of a friend of mine who does internal medicine in another state and he also didn't know anything about Lynch beyond its connection to colon cancer. 

Lynch is too niche for most PCP I think. Wish I had known that back in 2017 when he told me I didn't need to be tested. Might have avoided my cancer.

Quick history: 56F, dx Jan 2023 S4 colon cancer with Mets to ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and a spot on the lung. 20+ rounds of Avastin, 15 rounds of folfoxiri, and CRS+HIPEC in August 2023. Currently on monthly infusions of Avastin & Irinotecan. 

She’s had multiple kidney & heart issues since the start of this year & has also had unbearable lower back pain. The onc & pain management team tried variety of pain meds but the back ache persisted. The oncologist was wondering & I was spiraling about bone mets. Bone mets, btw, are not very common and are late stage. 

She had a pet scan in April 2024 & no bone Mets. The lower back pain is because of calcium deficiency, lack of movement, and ongoing medication. Pain meds & calcium supplements are managing it well.

LizzieMac123,"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time. Same with a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) or your state's equivalent- you can't join mid-year without a QLE--- and open enrollment doesn't start until November for a January 1 effective date.",1719804535,HealthInsurance

allemm,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal.

MethodMaven,"I’m taking your questions in reverse order …

You can travel both with an osteomy pouch and an external bag.  In fact, even though I have a neobladder, I use a leg bag for long trips.  This makes it a lot easier to deal with delayed flights, finding a clean restroom, etc.

My tumor was not muscle invasive.  I was “lucky” - as removing my bladder and urethra removed all of my cancer.  Because of my age and gender, they also did a radical hysterectomy, but I don’t think your dad has to worry about that 🤣.

Neobladder vs urostomy is a very personal decision - it is not a better or worse answer, it is a ‘what works best for you’ answer. Because I also have scoliosis (a spinal condition) that makes it impossible to sleep on my back, a neobladder is best for me.  With a neobladder, I don’t have to worry about dislodging an external bag while sleeping on my side.  

For some, a pouch is the right answer - it is simple to use, you can wear it for several days, and the post surgery recovery is a lot faster.  Neobladder surgery takes a lot longer to recover from.  It is much more surgically invasive; you not only have to heal from that, you also have to ‘grow the pouch’.  This means that you gradually stretch the neobladder by making it hold a bit more urine - starting with 2 hours, then plus 10 minutes after a week or so, etc.   For me, this process took about 90 days to get to 3 hours.  I wet my pants several times.  

Your dad has to decide how he wants to manage his urinary needs post surgery.  Does he want to be chained to a clock - go pee every 3-4 hours, or risk wetting his pants (neobladder), but with the ability to side sleep or stomach sleep?  Or, does he want to be able to (kind of) forget about peeing until his bag is full - a few days?  But, he may need to confine his sleeping position to his back.

Lastly - older people of your dad’s generation (like me!) can find it difficult to seek mental help - counseling or therapy.  It is hard for us to believe that talking can assuage ones deep emotional pain.  But, ask your dad this - could it make him feel more scared than he already does?

Ok-Consequence203,"Ty so much for your detailed replies and for explaining everything. I definitely felt a little blindsided by the ANA test. I went to my orthopedist for hand numbness/tingling in both hands (it has since resolved) and some finger stiffness. No swelling or redness ever but I was scared it could be RA or early RA. X-ray clear but I know it could be too early to see anything. I asked him to send me for the RA blood panel and he included the ANA. I felt totally blindsided by the results because I wasn’t even thinking it could be another autoimmune condition besides RA. Wrist discomfort then developed but it hasn’t limited my activities and I have no muscle weakness, no swelling and redness still.

Everything came back normal with my RF, anti-CCP, CBC, ESR and CRP. I even followed up with an anti-SSA SSB with my family Dr (I swear I had extreme dry eyes and mouth for a few days. I was trying to reason with myself that either my anxiety manifested physical symptoms or exacerbated them). All negative but now I am worried it could be lupus.

Do you know if joint pain should be systemic and usually migrates to other joints (bottom half of my body) and not localized in my hands/wrists?

3DFarmer,"I went to one recently after my neurologist said something more was up. I brought a list of everything I've been feeling, even the small stuff like weird nail changes and a pre-cancer diagnosis. She did a full body exam, pressed on all my joints and then told me that I'm a little more flexible then most people and that's probably causing my pain. She said there is nothing she could do and that unless I was feeling pain in all of my joints all over then not to come back. I told her I was frustrated and she said she has prescribed medication before but it doesn't do anything for people like me. She said she would order labs for RA but not to expect anything and even if it was positive then she can't do anything because it's too early, she said to let the labs expire if I felt like it.

  
Well, I took the labs a few weeks later and I had a positive HlA-B27 and found out of a family history of psoriatic arthritis. She called when she got the results and said, actually, I need to see you by Friday and I need to see you every 6 months for the foreseeable future. She didn't want to give me any medication unless I told her I had been having pain for a decade, I have been having unexplained pain for at least that long or longer so she put me on Prednisone. I felt like I needed to argue for it but she did listen to me. I felt so much better after a week that she put me on Sulfasalazine and I'm waiting to see the effects.

  
I would ask for labs, maybe for the HLA gene and see where it goes. We are young, I'm just 29 but it's taken years of arguing to get someone to listen. It really wasn't until my neurologist reassured me that doctors will ignore me and to keep at it, that I put my thoughts of being an annoying patient aside and to keep at it that I actually got results.

Professor_Eindackel,"All the treatments have negative effects and make no mistake, it may not kill you if you catch it and treat it early, but prostate cancer still really sucks. As for choosing RALP, no way I wanted the chemical castration shots that go with radiation, and besides that radiation also can lead to incontinence and ED like RALP, as well as bowel problems that don’t seem to affect those who choose surgery. From what I have come to understand you experience the surgical side effects but things get better, with radiation the effects come later but you do you not bounce back. Every person is different and every case is different so I would talk to as many people and do as much research as you can. What was right for me may not be right for you.

My sister is a physician and she recommended the nerve-sparing RALP before I even saw my urologist for the biopsy, just in case it was positive. My incontinence lasted about 72 hours after the catheter was out and was very minor. ED is a work in progress. I am barely 5 months out and I was told it takes some time to fully recover from ED, many of the others who chose RALP have told their stories. Even if erections do not fully return there are shots like trimix and bimix, vacuum devices, implants etc. My surgeon uses a nerve monitoring device and he said everything checked out before and after the surgery, and he is very positive about my making a full recovery in every respect. 

Both radiation and RALP have their proponents in the medical field in on this board, you have to talk to your doctors, do your research and choose what is best for you. If I was older I probably would have gone the radiation route but I also like the idea of being able to do radiation if I ever have a biochemical recurrence. If you do radiation first it’s hard to do surgery later because of the tissue damage. It was also a relief to get the prostate out and get good pathology, which confirmed it was all contained, it was all Gleason 3+4 and nothing on the capsule, clean margins all around. So avoiding the chemical castration shot, as well as getting pathology on the gland that took away a lot of my anxiety made surgery well worth it to me.

A solid tumor was discovered in his right testicle (he went to the doc for testicular pain over a year ago and was told it was  likely a cyst and would go away) and an over 15 cm mass in his abdomen , retroperitoneaol space.  Three days later we saw an urology oncologist scheduled a removal and biopsy of the right testicle a few days later April 1st, but said we'd hit the tumor in his abdomen with chemotherapy and hopefully shrink it enough to remove because it was inoperable at the size it was.  He had the surgery to remove the testicle and biopsy results showed a NSGT, pure mature teratoma.  Now Teratoma 100% mature teratoma are malignant of you're past puberty.  Obviously he is.  It was taken for granted that the tumor in his abdomen was also Teratoma and Teratoma is resistant to Chemotherapy and Radiation;  the only option was to remove a huge inoperable tumor that's growing in a very risky place.  The surgery is scheduled for April 19th.  Told its a 6 hour surgery.  This surgery turned into a 14 hour surgery because removal caused his Aorta, ilieum (a major artery that turns to femoral artery a little further down( and all the vessels to his right kidney to tear.  His Aorta and Ilium had to be rebuilt and his right kidney was removed.  The tumor was also attached to his spine.  My son required multiple (10) blood transfusions and came out of surgery on life support and taken to ICU.  He woke 2 days later and was in the hospital 2 weeks, required several weeks of physical and occupational therapy, but doing better than expected. Biopsy results came back for the tumor that took so long because it was sent to IU and Dr. Einhorn for a second opinion.  They couldn't believe what they saw;  the inside, or the tumor that was attached to his Aorta was a Neuroendocrine tumor. Not a NSGT;  and all around it was NSGT, teratoma type.  So, 60% Teratoma, 40% NET.  We saw Dr. Einhorn a week later. He ordered another CT scan, were about 5 weeks post surgery.  He does feel we need chemotherapy right away.  CT results come back and it's in the lymph nodes in his neck, liver and throughout lungs.  He needs very strong chemo.  He needs probably 6 cycles and each cycle lasts 21 days.  On day one he was admitted and given Red Devil chemo, which can only be given one dose every 21 days, followed by a mixture of 3 different chemos for 5 days straight.  He has weekends off. And release the combo of 3 for 3 weeks in a row, then he gets a week off and repeat hospitalization for 5 days, with the first day being red devil, then he starts the other 3 combo. One cycle for him is 17 chemo treatments.  He just completed his first week of his second cycle on Friday . He's very sick, but we were told that he's going to be very sick. His prognosis was great, but this other cancer is throwing a wrench.  Honestly, we don't know that  this is going to works for him.  Dr.  Einhorn gives him about a 65% chance of surviving what they're calling metastatic Testicular Neuroendocrine Carcinoma associated with  teratoma, retroperitoneaol space and my son is the only documented case of these two types of cancer being together in the retroperitoneaol space and his oncologist where we live that actually oversees his chemo says he just isn't sure that it will work and if it doesn't, there aren't any other options.  He has a very aggressive and fast spreading case.  There's a lot of unknowns at this point and nobody to compare him to, but I know he's been through way too much in such a short period of time and has already beat the odds with this disease and the major and complicated  surgery it required to get him to where he is now that it has to work.  We are keeping the faith.  Attitude is everything.  ",1719818893,testicularcancer

It sucks it really really really does and it’s gonna suck for a while. I’m also so sorry you have to go through this at 18, I’m sorry you had to grow up so fast - you should have been able to enjoy your youth for longer, and to have your mom by your side. 

Are there any family members or friends you can lean on for support? Just to be with you and spend time with you so you don’t feel too alone? Try not to isolate yourself, even if you feel like nobody understands how you feel! There are people who really care about you and love you.

But that said, take alllll the time you need to process and reflect alone too. It’s okay to not be okay, and I think healing and grieving isn’t a linear process either, there’ll be good and bad days. 

Take it one step at a time, one day at a time. And know that your mom wouldn’t want you to be miserable forever, so when you’re ready, go out and enjoy life, taking your memories of her with you. Know she’s smiling down at you from above ❤️

Sending so much love and hugs to you!!! :”",1719822644,CancerCaregivers

I am so so sorry that you and your family are having to do this, and I know only too well that nothing anyone does or says can change anything.  

You are so strong, just to be able to talk about this, and I admire your courage tremendously. I wish there was something I could say or do to alleviate some of the pain from you, even if only temporarily.

Defiant_Brother_1172,"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can’t find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

cajunlady1972,"By no means am I a doctor & I don’t have children, so your symptoms may be related to that.  I had inverted nipple, along with hard, orange peeling skin, to side & a little underneath nipple.  My gut feeling was I had cancer.  So many times, I’d ignored those feelings & EVERY feeling was, later, proven right.  So I trusted it this time. 
Also, I researched, before I could see GYN, (had already made appt. Was just waiting for the day) & those 2 signs pointed to definite cancer.  Which I do have cancer.  I’m, very much, hoping that u do not have cancer & that whatever it is, is treatable. 
Now, in 2006, I had found a lump, right breast. Cancer is in left.  GYN didn’t seem too concerned, so she started by prescribing antibiotics & lump went away.  Never came back.

RaspberryUnited9501,"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",1719837665,cancer

Quirky-Sun762,"It made me realise exactly how little I had. And it’s impacted my relationship to the point it’s now in tatters and I’m not sure it can be salvaged. My partner had to manage his own health, which he then neglected and told me he did so so I could have cancer treatment. Meanwhile I then had to manage his emotions all the time and I could only express myself how he wanted. If I expressed myself in a way he didn’t like, I got shut down. Which, at times I needed, because I was taking it out on him. Other times, he was the reason I was frustrated and I couldn’t express it without being invalidated.

The only family member that really came through for me was my brother but even then, the actual emotional support was curbed in the only way my brother knew how to cope. My mom has been a huge disappointment but that’s not surprising. 

I no longer have the patience for people who won’t just communicate with me. Sometimes people want you to dig into them and draw the information out and I used to have the patience but not anymore. I cannot manage anyone else’s emotions anymore. I’ve become impatient. Irritable. Mean. But I’ve also become less of a people pleaser. I assert more boundaries. I am not everyone’s security blanket/bank/mother/whatever else.

What did surprise me were the one or two people who emerged out of the woodwork and proved to be friends I didn’t realise I had.

RipDouble8475,"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

And I was lucky I had no pain with my healing and I had it removed when I was finally NED (no evidence of disease) with it. Unfortunately, my cancer came back a few months later, and I got my port back in. It is true chemo is very hard on the veins. I also had all my lymph nodes removed from my right under arm, and I have a little Adema so I can’t even use that arm for blood pressure needles nothing so I’m actually really glad I got the port and when I got it put back in it was pretty much the same no pain. So I am to keep my fingers crossed that her pain stops and see if they will give her something to take for the pain or if they suggest Tylenol or maybe a warm compress. But she can’t blame her self and you can’t blame yourself either. Nobody knows these things until they actually happen, and it’s for the better good.

I applied to 4 jobs - all want experience. 

I opened a business - failed due to a dying market. 
studied for my dat, and then postponed it to save up more money for the test and apps that I could barely afford. And now I’m reviewing again because I forgot a lot of it. I still have the DAT to take this month. 

My hobbies? Hobbies are just making money.

Friends? I don’t talk to most of my friends cause I avoid “how are your applications going” “did you take the DAT” “wow, just don’t be lazy”. I homestead a party yesterday and they commented “so you’re not taking your test this year”, I kicked them out but they took it as a joke.

BUT, I’ve come to realize this is all apart of the journey. Every dental/med student goes through the same steps to reach dental school. That’s not on us, it’s on the US system. Other countries have their students graduating dental school at 23/24. ITS A 5 YEAR PROGRAM!

So yes. We are unproductive and not on full speed like others but when we do accelerate, we’re gonna be flying past them (with love) like a McLaren and a Prius.

I took an introspective look at all my friendships during that time and let some go. We were just not compatible as friends any longer and I need to put my sparse energy in people that deserve it. 

As far as non-relationship stuff, most of my future plans at the time of diagnosis are either dismantled or put on hold. My hormone therapy is hell on me, so I am trying to navigate that and realized I have limitations. That's okay. It forced me to slow down and gave me the ability to say no like a champion.

Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries.

rkb1990,"Just a few thoughts for you on this: first and foremost, it's tough, and it sucks, and sometimes there's no easy way to figure any of this out. There can be an expectation when we make it through cancer that all of a sudden we've got this clarity about how life works, or we should have clarity, or if we still muddle our way through like everyone else then somehow we've lost an ""opportunity"" given to us by cancer. That's just not true.

FWIW, I (55M) was about your age when I was diagnosed with AML in 1990 and felt or experienced much of what you've described. None of us are equipped to deal with a cancer diagnosis at 20-ish, not our friends, not our families, not us. You're still close enough to it that it's okay to rage. You should be angry, and sad, and emotionally drained because there's a lot to process.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll get through this. Time helps. Patience and kindness with yourself helps, too. With or without cancer, I still wouldn't have figured my shit out by the time I turned 30, or even come close to understanding the lasting impact it would have on my life. It will always be part of my story but I don't have to let it define or consume me.

RipDouble8475,"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

AngeredReclusivity,"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but: It's not just America. Most people just don't research other countries' health problems to know otherwise. 

For example, the media continuously will swear the US has the highest obesity and cancer rates when that's not true. We're top 5 for both, but not number one, with many countries in the Western world's obesity rates skyrocketing (and even outside the western world). American food can't be blamed for that, especially since other countries swear their food is healthier. 

Microplastics is a global problem, with many countries in the East suffering worse because they're the countries that ""recycle"" most of our plastic. I truly don't think we'll ever fix that issue (at least in my lifetime). 

Diseases evolve and change. Of course we'll have diseases that didn't exist hundreds of years ago. Part of that is due to how we live now and others because humans weren't living nearly as long as we do now. That's not an accurate indicator of general issues. We no longer have the Bubonic plague pandemic because of advances in medicine.

People are blaming healthcare alone, but for prevention to actually be viable, you have to fix the financial disparities in the US/elsewhere. Telling someone to eat fruits and veggies when they live in an area with corner stores/liquor stores/no grocery stores is like talking to the wall. Or telling someone to shop whole food items on a minimum wage salary while having 2 kids is like falling on deaf ears.

Finally, some people don't listen/care. We know cigarettes cause cancer at this point, yet people still smoke and will smoke until they die. This is actually a postulation as to the prevalence of certain cancers in Europe (high tobacco use).",1719849279,nursing

LizzieMac123,"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time. Same with a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) or your state's equivalent- you can't join mid-year without a QLE--- and open enrollment doesn't start until November for a January 1 effective date.",1719804535,HealthInsurance

allemm,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal.

CrazyCartwheels,"Checking perplexity.io for the term: ""Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal"" 

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal extension refers to a specific pathological finding in prostate cancer where the cancer cells have spread beyond the confines of a lymph node capsule. This finding is significant in the staging and prognosis of prostate cancer. Extranodal extension, also known as extracapsular extension, occurs when cancer cells breach the outer layer (capsule) of a lymph node and extend into the surrounding tissue. When this extension is described as ""focal,"" it indicates that the spread beyond the lymph node is limited in extent rather than widespread. The presence of extranodal extension is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer. It typically indicates a more aggressive disease and is associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence and poorer overall outcomes. This finding often influences treatment decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive therapeutic approaches. In the context of prostate cancer staging, the presence of focal extranodal extension would likely categorize the disease as at least stage III, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. However, the exact staging would depend on other factors such as the number of positive lymph nodes and the presence of distant metastases. It's important to note that while focal extranodal extension is a concerning finding, it does not necessarily mean the cancer is incurable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the overall extent of the disease and other individual patient factors.",1719829305,ProstateCancer

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.

Powerful_Village2508,"I feel like working in the medical field makes it all so easy to get worked up and panicky over increases in cancer and heart disease and environmental carcinogens (as well we should, I agree, since those are the problems at hand) that we totally overlook the sheer volume of children who died before the age of eight as recently as 100 years ago. Or the women who died giving birth. Or all the people, men, women, and children alike, who died of infections/illnesses that cheap, readily-available antibiotics can cure in 5-14 days nowadays. 

It’s easy to catastrophize when you’re faced with something what seems like all day every day. We all do it. But what drives this thinking is that humans simply don’t have the life expectancy to put and keep things in the proper perspective that would let you truly see that “if it’s not one thing it’s another.” But it’s true. And I think it’s really important for one’s sanity, if anything, to remember that we’re really not doing that bad overall. Everything is a trade off. At least that’s how I see it. 

The US is kind of a special case in terms of environmental protections because what flies and what doesn’t environmentally is likely to be decided by a patchwork of states and not consistently by any sort of federal authority (true even before the repeal of Chevron, to an extent, though of course that decision will make things worse) and that makes it harder for everyone to get on the same page. Not to mention our healthcare system is spotty as hell and remains unaffordable for lots of Americans despite the ACA, depending on what state you’re actually in. And we NEED to fix that. 

But I’m still comforted by the fact that I’m more likely to die of (perhaps environmentally-caused) cancer in 25 years than of rabies in like 3 weeks, statistically.",1719844854,nursing

This report dives deep into the analysis of a lymph node biopsy from your right neck using a technique called flow cytometry. Here's a breakdown with more details and a cautious approach to interpreting the results:

The Bad News (Potential):

The presence of an abnormal cell population expressing CD30 is a red flag. CD30 is a protein marker often associated with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system.
Increased Forward Scatter and Side Scatter suggest the cells are larger and more granular, another characteristic sometimes seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.
The Not-So-Bad News (Uncertainties):

The report emphasizes the need for morphologic correlation. This means looking at the cells under a microscope to confirm their exact shape and size. Flow cytometry can provide clues, but a definitive diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma relies heavily on microscopic examination.
Some markers like CD15 (positive) and CD40 (positive) can be positive in Hodgkin lymphoma, but they're not exclusive. Other types of lymphomas can also express them.
Markers like CD20 (weakly positive) and CD5 (variable) are typically negative in Hodgkin lymphoma, but the results here might be due to technical issues.
Overall:

This report raises a suspicion of Hodgkin lymphoma, but it's not conclusive. It's crucial to have the tissue sample examined by a pathologist under a microscope (morphologic correlation) for a definitive diagnosis.

Here's what likely happens next:

Your doctor will discuss these results with you and likely recommend further testing, including a lymph node biopsy analysis under a microscope.
Depending on the final diagnosis, they'll outline the next steps, which could involve additional tests, scans, or treatment options.

Then my procedure was originally scheduled a month or two away, but they ended up moving it up after they saw how upset/anxious I was about it. Overall you will probably have more than a month before your procedure. My doctor wasn't in a huge rush, but did state it needed to be treated soon. I have heard of people going much longer before treating theirs. Even if you are able to get the procedure sooner, I would wait until after your wedding. I would not have wanted to be recovering anywhere at home, especially while trying to celebrate my wedding. You will definitely have time to recover between your wedding and your graduation. Get your procedure scheduled after your wedding so you don't need to stress about that part and let yourself enjoy your wedding. 

Cervical cancer can take over a decade to develop. I had a clear pap 2 years ago and was scared of cancer because of how fast it developed to CIN 3. My doctor told me that the colposcopy/biopsy can also pick up cancer cells if they are present. You are most likely just CIN 3 and treatable. The next procedure can tell you more definitely, but since no malignancy was noted on the pathology report, that's a good sign!

For reference, I had CIN 3 all over the transformation zone. I had 3 biopsied spots around my cervix that came back as CIN 3 as well as my ECC. I had one spot of CIN 2. I ended up having a cone procedure because the CIN 3 in the ECC and also to get a better sample to ensure good margins. Recovery has not been bad, but I am grateful I'm able to work remotely at home and lay on the couch. I'm 5 days post-op right now.

Gibfeast,"No it didn’t, I ate spicy foods and all and never felt anything. No clue I had any ulcers. After the ulcer became bloody, I vomited blood out and they did an endoscopy. Not sure how long the ulcer had been there for.  

I also eat pretty healthy too, I stay away from seed oils, any preservatives like nitrates, grow my own veg garden with organic soil, ate a lot of mints which are anti-inflammatory. A daily matcha drink with adaptogenic mushroom extracts and raw honey, matcha powder. I also drank a superfoods smoothie 2-3x a week, I blended my own bc it has like 15 of the healthiest things you can eat, all things to reduce cancer risk. I figured doing all of that would really make my chances good, along with regular cardio exercise. Here I am, getting a diagnosis early in life. 

I’m talking to functional health experts and they believe I’m infected by parasites by my travels (eating street food and raw fish like sushi) and have SIBO, a bacterial overgrowth in my small intestine. So my immune function has been taxed. So even with all the healthy stuff thrown at it, the parasites had been depleting my nutrients, leaky gut syndrome. They do think bc I did all the healthy stuff, it may be the reason why it is not more advanced, the tumor is still small and no evidence is spread yet. They said if I get rid of the parasites, bacterial overgrowth, and restore acid function, then my immune system should be able to recognize cancer cells in the future and destroy them on my own.

susevda,"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

leavesandlove,"Hi! I’m 45, ++-, ki 27( or around that) I was already in menopause when I was diagnosed with cancer. 

What was done with tumor? I had a bilateral mastectomy, my choice.  Cancer was found in right breast, but I wanted to feel as balanced as possible.  They did find cancer cells in left as well, so thank god I did both. 

Here is what I know- that’s a fairly high ki score.  Your cancer was hormone fed, our body produces hormones in our ovaries and adrenal glands. Your body producing hormones is like throwing cheeseburgers at cancer- it can feed it. The purpose of the hormone blockers is to reduce the chance of it coming back.  Breast cancer can return to breasts or bone.

I don’t know a lot about pcos but I believe It is also an imbalance of hormones.  You may benefit.  

I will be honest I hate the hormone blockers.  We are trying a 3rd one now to see if it is any better.  I get horrible pain from them.  Estrogen is important in our bodies, but you have to decide which is more important. 

No estrogen means, aging skin( I don’t feel my hair quality has changed, I am gray but that was happening before chemo, now I just embrace it), joint pain, pain with sex( I could write a whole book on that) BUT it also helps keep cancer away…..

QHS_1111,"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

Cancer has changed everything. 

I lived with my partner when I first got diagnosed last year (+++). I don’t know if it was the stress of it all or what but I ended up moving after my DMX and before radiation. (Never underestimate the power of a person who has had enough bullshit lol). I learned that he was unable to support me at the worst time of my life.. and I hate to admit this but I don’t know if I would have left if it weren’t for the cancer. It was the cancer that gave me the push to just get out of a not so great (for me) situation. I’m actually really thankful for that. 

My coworkers were amazing during the entire process and I couldn’t be more thankful. Thing is about work.. it’s hard now to go to work. You are faced with this terrible news and it makes you contemplate what is important. Work just seems so… useless. Alas I live in the US and work is tired to insurance. Which we know we need.. so it’s a double edge sword. I know I have to go, but I’ve been more mindful about what I actually WANT to do now vs what I thought I should do before. 

I was a person who lived for others and relationships before. I know that’s not the way to have healthy relationships, but hey, that’s for another sub haha. I now spend time doing things I like. I run, bike and do everything outside because that’s what I enjoy. I think now I’m learning to slowly let go of things that don’t make me happy.

Defiant_Brother_1172,"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can’t find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

CrazyCartwheels,"Checking perplexity.io for the term: ""Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal"" 

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal extension refers to a specific pathological finding in prostate cancer where the cancer cells have spread beyond the confines of a lymph node capsule. This finding is significant in the staging and prognosis of prostate cancer. Extranodal extension, also known as extracapsular extension, occurs when cancer cells breach the outer layer (capsule) of a lymph node and extend into the surrounding tissue. When this extension is described as ""focal,"" it indicates that the spread beyond the lymph node is limited in extent rather than widespread. The presence of extranodal extension is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer. It typically indicates a more aggressive disease and is associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence and poorer overall outcomes. This finding often influences treatment decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive therapeutic approaches. In the context of prostate cancer staging, the presence of focal extranodal extension would likely categorize the disease as at least stage III, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. However, the exact staging would depend on other factors such as the number of positive lymph nodes and the presence of distant metastases. It's important to note that while focal extranodal extension is a concerning finding, it does not necessarily mean the cancer is incurable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the overall extent of the disease and other individual patient factors.",1719829305,ProstateCancer

RaspberryUnited9501,"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",1719837665,cancer
VariationForeign1673,"She could possibly be suffering from Anemia... FYI if you are not familiar with this disease already.
Anemia is a condition that occurs when the body doesn't produce enough healthy red blood cells or the red blood cells don't function properly. This prevents the body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood, which can lead to a number of symptoms:
Fatigue: Feeling weak or tired
Shortness of breath: Difficulty breathing
Dizziness: Feeling lightheaded
Headaches: Pain in the head
Irregular heartbeat: A fast or abnormal heart rate Other symptoms include:
Difficulty concentrating
Irritability
Loss of appetite
Numbness and tingling in the hands and feet
Pale skin
Cold extremities 
Mild anemia or anemia that develops slowly may not have any symptoms. However, if left unchecked, anemia can become serious and feel like a heart attack. A blood test can measure hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell levels to determine if anemia is present. 
Risk factors for anemia include:
Poor diet, Intestinal disorders, Chronic diseases, Infections, Menstruation or pregnancy, Chronic medical conditions, Age, Autoimmune diseases, Kidney disease, and Cancer. 
The most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which can be caused by blood loss, poor iron absorption, pregnancy, or gastric bypass surgery. Treatments for anemia vary depending on the type of anemia, but may include medication, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, surgery, painkillers, supplements, or oxygen therapy.

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

I wish you continued success on your journey, I'm genuinely happy to hear of your resilience and triumph thus far.",1719847712,cll

It was just food poisoning with an infection that escalated, and that’s just life.

In my gap year…

I applied to 4 jobs - all want experience. 

I opened a business - failed due to a dying market. 
studied for my dat, and then postponed it to save up more money for the test and apps that I could barely afford. And now I’m reviewing again because I forgot a lot of it. I still have the DAT to take this month. 

My hobbies? Hobbies are just making money.

Friends? I don’t talk to most of my friends cause I avoid “how are your applications going” “did you take the DAT” “wow, just don’t be lazy”. I homestead a party yesterday and they commented “so you’re not taking your test this year”, I kicked them out but they took it as a joke.

BUT, I’ve come to realize this is all apart of the journey. Every dental/med student goes through the same steps to reach dental school. That’s not on us, it’s on the US system. Other countries have their students graduating dental school at 23/24. ITS A 5 YEAR PROGRAM!

ExciteMeUp,"I’ll give you my experience with prednisone during my last 2 flare-ups, and some other experiences. 

I loved it at first. Was on 60mg a day for roughly a month, then dropped to 40mg, and began tapering off at 5mg each week for 2 months. 

I was naturally very skinny. 5’9, 135lbs. On prednisone I blew up to 175ish. Got moonface. I enjoyed the weight gain personally. It’s a lot of water weight and you will shed most of it. I stay around 155-160 now. 


The downsides… my vision went to shit. Now wear glasses. I’m not sure how big of a correlation my 2 flare-ups had with my vision going bad, but I did notice a degrade with it during and after my prednisone windows. 

Insomnia. It will be a pain getting to sleep during the first couple of weeks, but I adjusted. 

The worst part for me was the joint pain. It started about a month 1/2 on my first cycle. Absolutely terrible. I’d wake up with awful pain in every. single. joint. From fingertips down. My 2nd cycle I didn’t have it anywhere near as bad, but boy was the first awful. 

Appetite. Mine increased by about 300%. Example; would eat like 3 pieces of pizza from Dominos, to being able to eat an entire pizza + more in a sitting. I remember first seeing stretch marks around my cheeks/groin area and being like “wtf!”  So be ready to buy some fitting clothes if you gain a lot. 


I just had a colonoscopy last week, and everything was clear this go around. I’ve had 4 in the past 6-7 years. My last big flare up hospitalized me for a few days. Entire colon was covered. However, I was not on any preventatives at the time due to insurance issues. For the past year I’ve been on mesalamine (pill), but am swapping to Humira very soon as I just got better insurance that covers it.


Depending on how bad your case is (sometimes it seems like it’s worse than it is), your flareups won’t last long at all. You could stop bleeding/shitting 30x a day within a week on prednisone. I was diagnosed with IBS-D when I was around 15. It wasn’t until I had my first big flare at 30 they diagnosed me with UC. That was 8 years ago, and in the gap from then to now  I’ve had 1 major flare-up, and one small on that was starting up but I was able to tackle it quickly before it progressed. 


Diet wise, nothing I’ve found that I consume has caused any flare-ups. I eat whatever I want. I eat tons of spicy foods too. What I’ve noticed will throw me into a flare-up, is taking a shitload of ibuprofen for a week or two straight. I had some dental issues where I was taking 800mg x2 daily for about 2 weeks. Noticed some blood in the stool and immediately got ahold of my GI. Did stool and other lab work and started a 30mg prednisone routine and culled it before it took off. I was warned beforehand about NSAIDs & UC, but it was what I had at the time to deal with dental pain. 

Also, stress. I believe that attributed to my major flare-up a couple of years ago, and have been told/read it can be a factor. Try to do what you can to manage it. 

Try not to dwell too much on it. It absolutely sucks right now, and you’re going to overthink a lot of it (before I was diagnosed I got myself worried I had colon cancer). It’s super manageable though, and this could be the only flare you ever get. I know it sucks running to the bathroom so many times a day so your butt can sneeze out some blood & mucus, but the steroids will help. 


Talk to your doctor about preventatives. Here in the US we’ve got a few options. The ones I’m familiar with are Mesalamine (4x pills a day - I hated it), Humira (weekly/bi-weekly @home shot), Remicade (every 8 weeks, it reminds me of dialysis, maybe someone on it can give you more info).",1719848993,UlcerativeColitis

I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now.

allemm,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all.

Defiant_Brother_1172,"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon.

RaspberryUnited9501,"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",1719837665,cancer

-this-is-my-account-,"I had my abdormal pap about a month before my colposcopy/biopsy. Then my procedure was originally scheduled a month or two away, but they ended up moving it up after they saw how upset/anxious I was about it. Overall you will probably have more than a month before your procedure. My doctor wasn't in a huge rush, but did state it needed to be treated soon. I have heard of people going much longer before treating theirs. Even if you are able to get the procedure sooner, I would wait until after your wedding. I would not have wanted to be recovering anywhere at home, especially while trying to celebrate my wedding. You will definitely have time to recover between your wedding and your graduation. Get your procedure scheduled after your wedding so you don't need to stress about that part and let yourself enjoy your wedding. 

Cervical cancer can take over a decade to develop. I had a clear pap 2 years ago and was scared of cancer because of how fast it developed to CIN 3. My doctor told me that the colposcopy/biopsy can also pick up cancer cells if they are present. You are most likely just CIN 3 and treatable. The next procedure can tell you more definitely, but since no malignancy was noted on the pathology report, that's a good sign!

For reference, I had CIN 3 all over the transformation zone. I had 3 biopsied spots around my cervix that came back as CIN 3 as well as my ECC. I had one spot of CIN 2. I ended up having a cone procedure because the CIN 3 in the ECC and also to get a better sample to ensure good margins. Recovery has not been bad, but I am grateful I'm able to work remotely at home and lay on the couch. I'm 5 days post-op right now. I received my pathology report on Friday and haven't been able to talk to my doctor yet, but it did say no malignancy found in the cone in the report. (ECC did not have enough cells to test, which sucks) I know it's easier said than done, but try to wait until you talk to the doctor before you panic.",1719795113,PreCervicalCancer

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

I wish you continued success on your journey, I'm genuinely happy to hear of your resilience and triumph thus far.",1719847712,cll
AngeredReclusivity,"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but: It's not just America. Most people just don't research other countries' health problems to know otherwise. 

For example, the media continuously will swear the US has the highest obesity and cancer rates when that's not true. We're top 5 for both, but not number one, with many countries in the Western world's obesity rates skyrocketing (and even outside the western world). American food can't be blamed for that, especially since other countries swear their food is healthier. 

Microplastics is a global problem, with many countries in the East suffering worse because they're the countries that ""recycle"" most of our plastic. I truly don't think we'll ever fix that issue (at least in my lifetime). 

Diseases evolve and change. Of course we'll have diseases that didn't exist hundreds of years ago. Part of that is due to how we live now and others because humans weren't living nearly as long as we do now. That's not an accurate indicator of general issues. We no longer have the Bubonic plague pandemic because of advances in medicine.

People are blaming healthcare alone, but for prevention to actually be viable, you have to fix the financial disparities in the US/elsewhere. Telling someone to eat fruits and veggies when they live in an area with corner stores/liquor stores/no grocery stores is like talking to the wall. Or telling someone to shop whole food items on a minimum wage salary while having 2 kids is like falling on deaf ears.

Finally, some people don't listen/care. We know cigarettes cause cancer at this point, yet people still smoke and will smoke until they die. This is actually a postulation as to the prevalence of certain cancers in Europe (high tobacco use).",1719849279,nursing

Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

And that's where it sat for 5 years until I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. I pushed for testing again, and mentioned that Lynch was probably responsible, he told me I was wrong about Lynch!

Asked him to look it up on UpToDate (basically a medical encyclopedia for medical people to access during work - I work at a hospital that uses it so I'm familiar with it) and he did, during our visit.

For a lot of people with stage four cancer, probably for most of us, we will never be cured. But we can be treated and we might be here for years. Cancer can be, but that doesn’t mean it’s untreatable. 

I know that small lung cancer is a particularly brutal type of cancer and I’m sure that is a factor in your decision.

My advice is to get a referral to a palliative care doctor that is associated with your cancer center or hospital. This is a doctor that focuses on quality of life and they can help you understand what your life could be like if you underwent treatment and the possible time you could get from treatment. And they should also be able to talk to you about what will happen if you choose not to have treatment and how your disease will progress. And what can be done to keep you comfortable during that time.

They could talk to you about what time would be like when you are receiving hospice care. What are your options and where will you receive care and who would your primary caretakers be? These are all things that you need to think about if you choose not to have treatment.

Talk to the people closest to you, the ones you think can handle this discussion because not everybody can.

Or the women who died giving birth. Or all the people, men, women, and children alike, who died of infections/illnesses that cheap, readily-available antibiotics can cure in 5-14 days nowadays.

And I think it’s really important for one’s sanity, if anything, to remember that we’re really not doing that bad overall. Everything is a trade off. At least that’s how I see it. 

The US is kind of a special case in terms of environmental protections because what flies and what doesn’t environmentally is likely to be decided by a patchwork of states and not consistently by any sort of federal authority (true even before the repeal of Chevron, to an extent, though of course that decision will make things worse) and that makes it harder for everyone to get on the same page. Not to mention our healthcare system is spotty as hell and remains unaffordable for lots of Americans despite the ACA, depending on what state you’re actually in. And we NEED to fix that.

She’s had multiple kidney & heart issues since the start of this year & has also had unbearable lower back pain. The onc & pain management team tried variety of pain meds but the back ache persisted. The oncologist was wondering & I was spiraling about bone mets. Bone mets, btw, are not very common and are late stage. 

She had a pet scan in April 2024 & no bone Mets. The lower back pain is because of calcium deficiency, lack of movement, and ongoing medication. Pain meds & calcium supplements are managing it well.

LizzieMac123,"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time.

Sunshine12e,"Pretty much no one talked to me once I told them that I had cancer. Not a single sibling even called me or responded to the message that I sent. My brother's wife called. My son and mother called very rarely. My son sent one box of things for me.....but not anything else after that....My ex-husband, who I had been talking to nearly every day, either about our son or on support of his new business venture, literally said ""Why should I care. Why are you telling me"" and then once sent me a message saying I should come home (but i could not because it was total lockdown)...and then stopped talking to me altogether (and years after we had divorced, he moved in with my mother, son and myself. He even stayed living with my mother after my son and I moved elsewhere. So, it isn't like we had any issues with each other.). My youngest brother, who i also talked to every day, blocked me the day I found out--guess I was of no use). Several of my customers also stopped buying or reacting on social media, but several other customers were very supportive. Some customers chose that time to create headaches and drama......

KestrelLST,"I think it's fine to come across as an anxious mess, fwiw. But compile a clear and exhaustive list of symptoms and family history as well as what tests you've already had, so you don't forget something important. 

And I obviously can't say much positive about cancer, but just so you know, if it is somehow MS, MS is extremely treatable. Everyone experiences it differently but my grandfather has MS, is 80, was diagnosed almost 50 years ago when treatments were well behind where they are now, and is incredibly active and reads a ton and travels a lot and was able to be a fully involved parent to my dad.

allemm,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it.

MethodMaven,"I’m taking your questions in reverse order …

You can travel both with an osteomy pouch and an external bag.  In fact, even though I have a neobladder, I use a leg bag for long trips.  This makes it a lot easier to deal with delayed flights, finding a clean restroom, etc.

My tumor was not muscle invasive.  I was “lucky” - as removing my bladder and urethra removed all of my cancer.  Because of my age and gender, they also did a radical hysterectomy, but I don’t think your dad has to worry about that 🤣.

Neobladder vs urostomy is a very personal decision - it is not a better or worse answer, it is a ‘what works best for you’ answer. Because I also have scoliosis (a spinal condition) that makes it impossible to sleep on my back, a neobladder is best for me.  With a neobladder, I don’t have to worry about dislodging an external bag while sleeping on my side.  

For some, a pouch is the right answer - it is simple to use, you can wear it for several days, and the post surgery recovery is a lot faster.  Neobladder surgery takes a lot longer to recover from.  It is much more surgically invasive; you not only have to heal from that, you also have to ‘grow the pouch’.  This means that you gradually stretch the neobladder by making it hold a bit more urine - starting with 2 hours, then plus 10 minutes after a week or so, etc.   For me, this process took about 90 days to get to 3 hours.  I wet my pants several times.  

Your dad has to decide how he wants to manage his urinary needs post surgery.  Does he want to be chained to a clock - go pee every 3-4 hours, or risk wetting his pants (neobladder), but with the ability to side sleep or stomach sleep?  Or, does he want to be able to (kind of) forget about peeing until his bag is full - a few days?  But, he may need to confine his sleeping position to his back.

Lastly - older people of your dad’s generation (like me!) can find it difficult to seek mental help - counseling or therapy.  It is hard for us to believe that talking can assuage ones deep emotional pain.  But, ask your dad this - could it make him feel more scared than he already does?  

I hope the above helps you and your family. ♥️🧧🍀🤞",1719809252,BladderCancer
Ok-Consequence203,"Ty so much for your detailed replies and for explaining everything. I definitely felt a little blindsided by the ANA test. I went to my orthopedist for hand numbness/tingling in both hands (it has since resolved) and some finger stiffness. No swelling or redness ever but I was scared it could be RA or early RA. X-ray clear but I know it could be too early to see anything. I asked him to send me for the RA blood panel and he included the ANA. I felt totally blindsided by the results because I wasn’t even thinking it could be another autoimmune condition besides RA. Wrist discomfort then developed but it hasn’t limited my activities and I have no muscle weakness, no swelling and redness still.

Everything came back normal with my RF, anti-CCP, CBC, ESR and CRP. I even followed up with an anti-SSA SSB with my family Dr (I swear I had extreme dry eyes and mouth for a few days. I was trying to reason with myself that either my anxiety manifested physical symptoms or exacerbated them). All negative but now I am worried it could be lupus. I keep reading about wrist pain/hand pain.

Do you know if joint pain should be systemic and usually migrates to other joints (bottom half of my body) and not localized in my hands/wrists?

Freaking out until I see my family Dr this week. Debating whether I should ask for a dsdna antibodies test. I was lucky enough to make an appointment with a rheumatologist for the end of the month.

Bear in mind that your Mum may be feeling a lot of complex emotions right now.  Her mind will possibly change a few times, but she wants the right to reserve a dignified goodbye to the world.

She will be very concerned about being a burden to you.  Please, please get in touch with Cancer organisations to give you both the best advice and care.  

The hospital or doctors, or even your church can put you in touch with the right assistance.  Even Rotary, Freemason's or Lions Club might be helpful.  Don't be afraid to be frank and explain to them what you have written here about the circumstances.

For example, in my town in NSW, a church has small but nice accommodation, near a pretty park in a lovely suburb for end of life care, for people of their faith.

Since I am the only person my father has, it has come with a lot of responsibility. I have been on autopilot for months, taking him to appointments, chemo, doing the grocery shopping, cleaning and cooking. Making memories was important to me since my father and daughter are close. We had ice cream parties, tea parties, watched funny movies, went for drives or just laid on his bed with him and told each other funny stories. Now that I have been given the prognosis of 2 weeks to a month and we are at the end, those memories will forever make me smile. I am glad I was able to leave my job and take care of my dad. I am glad he knows how loved he is and he feels cared about. I have already grieved him in many ways. He is not very aware now and the dementia has gotten bad. This has been the hardest step yet, but also there is a certain peace knowing he won’t be suffering for much longer. I hope you can make peace with it. Know you did your best, make sure she knows how loved she is, make sure you have a voice message saved from her and you take pics. If you can, maybe take her for a drive?

paasaaplease,"I was diagnosed with widely invasive follicular thyroid cancer at 31F. 

These are so much easier said than done, but my best two pieces of advice --

1. Realize this stress will get you nowhere. If worrying could cure cancer, it'd be cured l. If you spend all this energy stressing out and it's a good outcome, what was the stress for? Nothing. I'd you spend all this energy stressing out and it's the (very unlikely) bad outcome, why did you waste your time with stress? Realize it's pointless.

2. Worry about what you can control, focus on what you can control. This is going to all appointments, being an informed patient, taking your medication, and taking good gentle care of yourself.

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

susevda,"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.
