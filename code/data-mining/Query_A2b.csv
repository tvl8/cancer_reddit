"I'd like to think I've dealt with cancer head on, on a personal level, after losing my mum to small cell lung cancer the day before my daughters first birthday, then my dad also to small cell lung cancer, 3 days before my daughters 7th birthday.  

But holy shit! as a dad, I couldn't even begin to comprehend what you are going through. the emotions, the pain, the struggle of not being able to protect your own child from a disease so invasive and destructive. I am so so sorry that you and your family are having to do this, and I know only too well that nothing anyone does or says can change anything.  

You are so strong, just to be able to talk about this, and I admire your courage tremendously. I wish there was something I could say or do to alleviate some of the pain from you, even if only temporarily.  

I mean this from the bottom of my heart.....if you need someone to rant at, vent your anger and frustration, or even someone to just talk about random mundane stuff to bring some kind of normality to your mind, even if just for a short while, my DMs are open to you, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.  

Fuck cancer so fucking much.",0,1719826058,CancerFamilySupport
"thank you for pointing out how it’s misunderstood. people constantly tell me “at least it’s not a terminal illness like cancer” or “they could’ve caught it later” and it’s not helpful. it just hurts because i feel like im overreacting bc my symptoms aren’t as bad right now or the condition itself isn’t going to kill me. i have been back to my normal self while on prednisone (about to start remicade finally) but when i have cramps or even have to go to the bathroom people think i’m having a full flare or are like “o thought you were fine? you were fine earlier”. it’s so frustrating not being able to express how it takes a toll on you physically and mentally, even when you’re feeling alright",0,1719799836,CrohnsDisease
"It made me realise exactly how little I had. And it’s impacted my relationship to the point it’s now in tatters and I’m not sure it can be salvaged. My partner had to manage his own health, which he then neglected and told me he did so so I could have cancer treatment. Meanwhile I then had to manage his emotions all the time and I could only express myself how he wanted. If I expressed myself in a way he didn’t like, I got shut down. Which, at times I needed, because I was taking it out on him. Other times, he was the reason I was frustrated and I couldn’t express it without being invalidated.

The only family member that really came through for me was my brother but even then, the actual emotional support was curbed in the only way my brother knew how to cope. My mom has been a huge disappointment but that’s not surprising. 

I no longer have the patience for people who won’t just communicate with me. Sometimes people want you to dig into them and draw the information out and I used to have the patience but not anymore. I cannot manage anyone else’s emotions anymore. I’ve become impatient. Irritable. Mean. But I’ve also become less of a people pleaser. I assert more boundaries. I am not everyone’s security blanket/bank/mother/whatever else.

What did surprise me were the one or two people who emerged out of the woodwork and proved to be friends I didn’t realise I had. No one ever visited me or anything but there were people who reached out that I never thought would. And the people I thought would reach out never did. Life is a funny one.",0,1719847236,breastcancer
"Absolutely! There aren’t many of us with high grade thyroid cancer. I feel like it’s so under researched, it’s definitely scary and frustrating. I’m always happy to chat if you need someone who gets it.",0,1719851099,thyroidcancer
"You are not alone... I am a 22y/o and I had my surgery in January...now finding out I may have lung involvement after RAI... I thought I was done and things were starting to clear up but they're not. So much waiting and struggle. I've had the same experience as you with people saying I'm lucky to have had thyroid cancer as opposed to other cancers but they just don't get it. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and stressed and scared. Just because thyroid cancer has a good prognosis doesn't mean it's less hard to go through.

Everything has been fine with my medication but I still understand what you feel. For my situation, I feel the same frustration with not being able to move on with my life, but for me it's from this new possible lung spread. You're not alone. You are valid. You are strong. And I promise that whatever you're doing, no matter how little, is important and matters. You can do this.",0,1719802666,thyroidcancer
"Yeah, could be a stomach bug, could be cancer that has spread to the brain. Why not wait it out? Grrrr! Your parents are frustrating me.

Call an ambulance anyway. He needs to go to the hospital!",0,1719803698,AskDocs
"A mix of sad, frustrated and pissed because it's a chronic condition and no one really knows what causes it. It also sucks that we have to be always on meds and that our risks of developing colon cancer are bigger.",0,1719810673,UlcerativeColitis
"I went to one recently after my neurologist said something more was up. I brought a list of everything I've been feeling, even the small stuff like weird nail changes and a pre-cancer diagnosis. She did a full body exam, pressed on all my joints and then told me that I'm a little more flexible then most people and that's probably causing my pain. She said there is nothing she could do and that unless I was feeling pain in all of my joints all over then not to come back. I told her I was frustrated and she said she has prescribed medication before but it doesn't do anything for people like me. She said she would order labs for RA but not to expect anything and even if it was positive then she can't do anything because it's too early, she said to let the labs expire if I felt like it.

  
Well, I took the labs a few weeks later and I had a positive HlA-B27 and found out of a family history of psoriatic arthritis. She called when she got the results and said, actually, I need to see you by Friday and I need to see you every 6 months for the foreseeable future. She didn't want to give me any medication unless I told her I had been having pain for a decade, I have been having unexplained pain for at least that long or longer so she put me on Prednisone. I felt like I needed to argue for it but she did listen to me. I felt so much better after a week that she put me on Sulfasalazine and I'm waiting to see the effects.

  
I would ask for labs, maybe for the HLA gene and see where it goes. We are young, I'm just 29 but it's taken years of arguing to get someone to listen. It really wasn't until my neurologist reassured me that doctors will ignore me and to keep at it, that I put my thoughts of being an annoying patient aside and to keep at it that I actually got results. Maybe you don't have an autoimmune disease but that doesn't mean your experiences aren't valid and you don't need assistance.",0,1719810959,Autoimmune
"That last line about seeing a colourful bird just got me ♥️ My Dad has been struggling through bladder cancer for two years now and his prognosis just gets bleaker. He was with a medical team in Toronto who sat on his cancer recurrence and instead of treatment just ordered rounds of tests for 4 months. The cancer has now spread, he’s with another team at a different hospital, but his physical and mental health are suffering and it feels like he’s giving up. My heart truly goes out to you and everything you’ve been through the frustration of having to push for treatment and to advocate for the people you love is so hard.",0,1719846063,BladderCancer
