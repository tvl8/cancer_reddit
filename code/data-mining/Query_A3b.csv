Thanks for your reply. I went to a v famous breast oncologist who prescribed mammogram and ultrasound and also checked my lump. Mammogram didn‚Äôt even showed the lump even when she could touch it and move it. My mom would have been here sitting with me gossiping about every one and laughing if they would have diagnosed her cancer the first time she went to see doctor¬†,0,1719826982,doihavebreastcancer
"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom‚Äôs diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven‚Äôt really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT‚Äôs, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn‚Äôt want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don‚Äôt let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can‚Äôt find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",0,1719837665,cancer

"It can be inherited but can also occur as a random mutation. LS can be caused by a single nucleotide change/mutation, and there are several factors that could promote the occurrence of a mutation like that (e.g., environmental exposures, random chance).

We also have to consider that recordkeeping in terms of cancer identification, diagnosis, treatment, and cause of mortality are also fairly recent in human history; I'm 34 and I really only have reliable family history data to look at back to the later years of my grandparents. If they didn't tell me about any cancers they had earlier in their lives, it's unlikely that I would be able to find out about them.

So if you don't have a history of a certain type of cancer that women get in your family, it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't or won't occur! It's possible that it was passed down from your father, that it was obscured in past recordkeeping practices, or that people have just gotten lucky in terms of MSH6 cancers in your family!

MSH6 also seems to be one of the ""less bad"" types of LS, with lower overall risks of cancers relative to MSH2 and other types of LS (but still greater, and for certain cancers significantly greater, than the risk for someone without LS). I inherited MSH6 from my mom, and we think we inherited it from her father who died of brain cancer at 72 (but had not had cancer prior to that). Our extended family members took tests as well, and maternal grandfather's sister found out she has MSH6 too. Her first cancer was found when she was in her 80s! But meanwhile my mom (66) has been one of the not-so-lucky people with MSH6, and is currently recovering from her 4th cancer.

"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time.

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it. 

I don't know if anything I said was really helpful, but I hope it was. I'm sending you and your wife a ton of love right now and hoping this particular issue will become less important as she heals from the surgery and the pain subsides.",0,1719808898,breastcancer
"I‚Äôm taking your questions in reverse order ‚Ä¶

You can travel both with an osteomy pouch and an external bag.  In fact, even though I have a neobladder, I use a leg bag for long trips.  This makes it a lot easier to deal with delayed flights, finding a clean restroom, etc.

My tumor was not muscle invasive.  I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù - as removing my bladder and urethra removed all of my cancer.  Because of my age and gender, they also did a radical hysterectomy, but I don‚Äôt think your dad has to worry about that ü§£.

Neobladder vs urostomy is a very personal decision - it is not a better or worse answer, it is a ‚Äòwhat works best for you‚Äô answer. Because I also have scoliosis (a spinal condition) that makes it impossible to sleep on my back, a neobladder is best for me.  With a neobladder, I don‚Äôt have to worry about dislodging an external bag while sleeping on my side.  

For some, a pouch is the right answer - it is simple to use, you can wear it for several days, and the post surgery recovery is a lot faster.  Neobladder surgery takes a lot longer to recover from.  It is much more surgically invasive; you not only have to heal from that, you also have to ‚Äògrow the pouch‚Äô.  This means that you gradually stretch the neobladder by making it hold a bit more urine - starting with 2 hours, then plus 10 minutes after a week or so, etc.   For me, this process took about 90 days to get to 3 hours.  I wet my pants several times.  

Your dad has to decide how he wants to manage his urinary needs post surgery.  Does he want to be chained to a clock - go pee every 3-4 hours, or risk wetting his pants (neobladder), but with the ability to side sleep or stomach sleep?  Or, does he want to be able to (kind of) forget about peeing until his bag is full - a few days?  But, he may need to confine his sleeping position to his back.

Lastly - older people of your dad‚Äôs generation (like me!) can find it difficult to seek mental help - counseling or therapy.  It is hard for us to believe that talking can assuage ones deep emotional pain.  But, ask your dad this - could it make him feel more scared than he already does?  

I hope the above helps you and your family. ‚ô•Ô∏èüßßüçÄü§û",0,1719809252,BladderCancer

"Ty so much for your detailed replies and for explaining everything. I definitely felt a little blindsided by the ANA test. I went to my orthopedist for hand numbness/tingling in both hands (it has since resolved) and some finger stiffness. No swelling or redness ever but I was scared it could be RA or early RA. X-ray clear but I know it could be too early to see anything. I asked him to send me for the RA blood panel and he included the ANA. I felt totally blindsided by the results because I wasn‚Äôt even thinking it could be another autoimmune condition besides RA. Wrist discomfort then developed but it hasn‚Äôt limited my activities and I have no muscle weakness, no swelling and redness still.

Everything came back normal with my RF, anti-CCP, CBC, ESR and CRP. I even followed up with an anti-SSA SSB with my family Dr (I swear I had extreme dry eyes and mouth for a few days. I was trying to reason with myself that either my anxiety manifested physical symptoms or exacerbated them). All negative but now I am worried it could be lupus. I keep reading about wrist pain/hand pain.

Do you know if joint pain should be systemic and usually migrates to other joints (bottom half of my body) and not localized in my hands/wrists?

"I went to one recently after my neurologist said something more was up. I brought a list of everything I've been feeling, even the small stuff like weird nail changes and a pre-cancer diagnosis. She did a full body exam, pressed on all my joints and then told me that I'm a little more flexible then most people and that's probably causing my pain. She said there is nothing she could do and that unless I was feeling pain in all of my joints all over then not to come back. I told her I was frustrated and she said she has prescribed medication before but it doesn't do anything for people like me. She said she would order labs for RA but not to expect anything and even if it was positive then she can't do anything because it's too early, she said to let the labs expire if I felt like it.

  
Well, I took the labs a few weeks later and I had a positive HlA-B27 and found out of a family history of psoriatic arthritis. She called when she got the results and said, actually, I need to see you by Friday and I need to see you every 6 months for the foreseeable future. She didn't want to give me any medication unless I told her I had been having pain for a decade, I have been having unexplained pain for at least that long or longer so she put me on Prednisone. I felt like I needed to argue for it but she did listen to me. I felt so much better after a week that she put me on Sulfasalazine and I'm waiting to see the effects.

  
I would ask for labs, maybe for the HLA gene and see where it goes. We are young, I'm just 29 but it's taken years of arguing to get someone to listen. It really wasn't until my neurologist reassured me that doctors will ignore me and to keep at it, that I put my thoughts of being an annoying patient aside and to keep at it that I actually got results. Maybe you don't have an autoimmune disease but that doesn't mean your experiences aren't valid and you don't need assistance.",0,1719810959,Autoimmune

"All the treatments have negative effects and make no mistake, it may not kill you if you catch it and treat it early, but prostate cancer still really sucks. As for choosing RALP, no way I wanted the chemical castration shots that go with radiation, and besides that radiation also can lead to incontinence and ED like RALP, as well as bowel problems that don‚Äôt seem to affect those who choose surgery. From what I have come to understand you experience the surgical side effects but things get better, with radiation the effects come later but you do you not bounce back. Every person is different and every case is different so I would talk to as many people and do as much research as you can. What was right for me may not be right for you.

My sister is a physician and she recommended the nerve-sparing RALP before I even saw my urologist for the biopsy, just in case it was positive. My incontinence lasted about 72 hours after the catheter was out and was very minor. ED is a work in progress. I am barely 5 months out and I was told it takes some time to fully recover from ED, many of the others who chose RALP have told their stories. Even if erections do not fully return there are shots like trimix and bimix, vacuum devices, implants etc. My surgeon uses a nerve monitoring device and he said everything checked out before and after the surgery, and he is very positive about my making a full recovery in every respect. 

Both radiation and RALP have their proponents in the medical field in on this board, you have to talk to your doctors, do your research and choose what is best for you. If I was older I probably would have gone the radiation route but I also like the idea of being able to do radiation if I ever have a biochemical recurrence. If you do radiation first it‚Äôs hard to do surgery later because of the tissue damage. It was also a relief to get the prostate out and get good pathology, which confirmed it was all contained, it was all Gleason 3+4 and nothing on the capsule, clean margins all around. So avoiding the chemical castration shot, as well as getting pathology on the gland that took away a lot of my anxiety made surgery well worth it to me.

"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

"Honestly, don't expect your PCP to know much, if anything, about Lynch. Mine was under the impression that it was ""just a colon cancer thing"" and refused to text me after I learned it was in my family. Because I was old enough that ""It wouldn't change the screening recommendations anyway""

And that's where it sat for 5 years until I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. I pushed for testing again, and mentioned that Lynch was probably responsible, he told me I was wrong about Lynch! I was stunned. Asked him to look it up on UpToDate (basically a medical encyclopedia for medical people to access during work - I work at a hospital that uses it so I'm familiar with it) and he did, during our visit. Apologized and said he'd learn more about Lynch before our next visit.

I then talked with the husband of a friend of mine who does internal medicine in another state and he also didn't know anything about Lynch beyond its connection to colon cancer. 

Lynch is too niche for most PCP I think. Wish I had known that back in 2017 when he told me I didn't need to be tested. Might have avoided my cancer.

We have 15 acres with horses, dogs, and cows. So I‚Äôve been able to be outside a lot and still away from people.

"i was always known for my hair. it was always long, healthy, thick, and shiny. my oncologist assured that my hair was absolutely going to fall out with my chemo regimen (also a blood cancer). radical acceptance is the way to be at peace with this, or at least have some semblance of it in my opinion. 

i had my mom shave my head the day after my first chemo. i essentially bit the bullet, and i‚Äôm so glad i did. my hair shortly after started falling out in clumps, the little buzzes that were left. i couldn‚Äôt imagine having my long locks on my pillow like that every morning. plus my scalp was soooo sore and sensitive. 

i wore beautiful head scarves, cool wig hats, and eventually just rocked the bald. it was incredibly liberating actually. i missed my hair of course, but there was just simply nothing that could be done about it so it was much easier to cope with when i accepted it.

The positive is that I‚Äôve leaned all the stupid things not to say to someone with cancer by all the stupid things that have been said to me.

"It made me realise exactly how little I had. And it‚Äôs impacted my relationship to the point it‚Äôs now in tatters and I‚Äôm not sure it can be salvaged. My partner had to manage his own health, which he then neglected and told me he did so so I could have cancer treatment. Meanwhile I then had to manage his emotions all the time and I could only express myself how he wanted. If I expressed myself in a way he didn‚Äôt like, I got shut down. Which, at times I needed, because I was taking it out on him. Other times, he was the reason I was frustrated and I couldn‚Äôt express it without being invalidated.

The only family member that really came through for me was my brother but even then, the actual emotional support was curbed in the only way my brother knew how to cope. My mom has been a huge disappointment but that‚Äôs not surprising. 

I no longer have the patience for people who won‚Äôt just communicate with me. Sometimes people want you to dig into them and draw the information out and I used to have the patience but not anymore. I cannot manage anyone else‚Äôs emotions anymore. I‚Äôve become impatient. Irritable. Mean. But I‚Äôve also become less of a people pleaser. I assert more boundaries. I am not everyone‚Äôs security blanket/bank/mother/whatever else.

What did surprise me were the one or two people who emerged out of the woodwork and proved to be friends I didn‚Äôt realise I had.

"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

I didn‚Äôt even realize that‚Äôs what they were doing at that moment. And I was lucky I had no pain with my healing and I had it removed when I was finally NED (no evidence of disease) with it. Unfortunately, my cancer came back a few months later, and I got my port back in. It is true chemo is very hard on the veins. I also had all my lymph nodes removed from my right under arm, and I have a little Adema so I can‚Äôt even use that arm for blood pressure needles nothing so I‚Äôm actually really glad I got the port and when I got it put back in it was pretty much the same no pain. So I am to keep my fingers crossed that her pain stops and see if they will give her something to take for the pain or if they suggest Tylenol or maybe a warm compress. But she can‚Äôt blame her self and you can‚Äôt blame yourself either. Nobody knows these things until they actually happen, and it‚Äôs for the better good.

"What happened to me is the endometrial was diagnosed first, low grade stage 1a, so they told me to keep ovaries since I was not in menopause. Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now. I do have lung nodules, but they are not believed to be metastatic. It's really all a guessing game of anxiety, isn't it.",0,1719849610,endometrialcancer

There can be an expectation when we make it through cancer that all of a sudden we've got this clarity about how life works, or we should have clarity, or if we still muddle our way through like everyone else then somehow we've lost an ""opportunity"" given to us by cancer.

FWIW, I (55M) was about your age when I was diagnosed with AML in 1990 and felt or experienced much of what you've described. None of us are equipped to deal with a cancer diagnosis at 20-ish, not our friends, not our families, not us. You're still close enough to it that it's okay to rage. You should be angry, and sad, and emotionally drained because there's a lot to process.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll get through this. Time helps. Patience and kindness with yourself helps, too. With or without cancer, I still wouldn't have figured my shit out by the time I turned 30, or even come close to understanding the lasting impact it would have on my life.
