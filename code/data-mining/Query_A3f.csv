"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

Finally, I am not recommending any treatment, just sharing my experience and putting the information out there.",0,1719839251,breastcancer
"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.  I live a very simple life focused around family, friends and experiences.  It’s beautiful!",0,1719841803,breastcancer
"I was diagnosed with CIN3 after 2 abnormal paps and one normal pap since 21, currently 23. I chose to hold off on treatment for 4 months and try lifestyle changes and AHCC before doing LEEP. I smoked before and I’m hoping stopping that makes a big difference.

"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

I wish you continued success on your journey, I'm genuinely happy to hear of your resilience and triumph thus far.",0,1719847712,cll
"What happened to me is the endometrial was diagnosed first, low grade stage 1a, so they told me to keep ovaries since I was not in menopause. Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now. I do have lung nodules, but they are not believed to be metastatic. It's really all a guessing game of anxiety, isn't it.",0,1719849610,endometrialcancer
"Support from people I didn’t expect it from, which makes me rethink how I handle things when I hear someone else is going through a difficult situation.  I’m an introvert and always figure others are surrounded by others and they don’t really know me or need me.  At this point I realize that I need to respond (card, calls, meal, drop by to help) and let them define their level of need—-I need to stop defining it by my own comfort levels. 
Weirdly, my most helpful support came from someone I barely knew personally. A teacher, who I had to inform about surgery/chemo, due to impact on classes. She was fully curious about it all, asked a million questions and gave me someone to talk to without complicating a relationship.
Unfortunately, my SO has done little more than occasionally ask if I need anything. And my brother hasn’t said/done anything. I’ve called him about other family issues and he’s never asked how I am. That hurts. 
I’m still in treatment but plan to look into some therapy to help settle all that has come unmoored by the cancer.  I don’t trust my feelings fully right now—body and brain full of foreign and toxic things, but I know I need to find a calmer focus and kinder path on the way out of this crazy.",0,1719852868,breastcancer
"I did IV, no port. I used ice bags on my hands and feet. I could only use my right arm for IV due to the mastectomy. I walked around or sat in my chair. I think sessions were 2-3 hours, not 4-6. One vein is shot. Otherwise, all is well. It's doable. If you don't trust your team, you should wait on treatment. Honestly, you need to trust your team. Cancer is a huge emotional roller coaster and you don't need the stress of second guessing your team. Hope my experience brings you some relief that a port is not always necessary. Please discuss it with your team. Be well.",0,1719802713,breastcancer
"Today was cousin went through with the decision to pull the plug. He's not someone like a son to me but man did this really relate to me... everything you mentioned to the cancer spreading to the low blood levels to his organs failing... my cousin went through all of that, and now he's made his decision. It spread to his brain and came back even though he fought it once already. I told him what was probably my final goodbye today. I couldn't help but lose it when he asked for me with his trembling voice because I was his closest cousin. Trust me, I know exactly what you're feeling. You're not alone. FUCK cancer",0,1719806973,CancerFamilySupport
"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it. 

I don't know if anything I said was really helpful, but I hope it was. I'm sending you and your wife a ton of love right now and hoping this particular issue will become less important as she heals from the surgery and the pain subsides.",0,1719808898,breastcancer
"Angry bladder as in overactive bladder or Interstitial cystitis? From my quick research RAI has only ever had an effect on kidneys when kidney disease was already present and that was seen usually within the first 9ish months. The bladder is an organ that is known to heal itself quite quickly and over 98% of i131 is gone in 48 hours so I’m not sure how much of a correlation there would be. Also, remember that health issues can and do happen unrelated to having thyroid cancer and RAI.

I do have to add the disclaimer that I am not a doctor or a research scientist.",0,1719810643,thyroidcancer
"By no means am I a doctor & I don’t have children, so your symptoms may be related to that.  I had inverted nipple, along with hard, orange peeling skin, to side & a little underneath nipple.  My gut feeling was I had cancer.  So many times, I’d ignored those feelings & EVERY feeling was, later, proven right.  So I trusted it this time. 
Also, I researched, before I could see GYN, (had already made appt. Was just waiting for the day) & those 2 signs pointed to definite cancer.  Which I do have cancer.  I’m, very much, hoping that u do not have cancer & that whatever it is, is treatable. 
Now, in 2006, I had found a lump, right breast. Cancer is in left.  GYN didn’t seem too concerned, so she started by prescribing antibiotics & lump went away.  Never came back. Can’t remember what she diagnosed it as that she started with antibiotics.  So I’m hoping it’s that easy of a fix for u!  🤗🤗💜💜💜",0,1719830928,doihavebreastcancer
"I don't know if this helps. But now is the best time to have cancer. What I would recommend is trusting the doctor's advice. They know what's best. And I would prepare for when the tumor reoccurs. There's a great website where you can see all the clinical trials that are happening in the country at clinicaltrials.gov. There's a lot of clinical trials that have great results right now. I was diagnosed with an astrocytoma in November and what I can say is that it is a very, very stressful process. I can't imagine what it is like to have a child go through that.

"I'll go to the ER at literally the first sign of infection. I'm well versed in regular wound care and infection. But the simple fact is that I do not have the option to see a physician sooner than Monday the 8^(th), and this is not something I trust to some rando PA. Last time I was in an urgent care with a PA, the dude didn't know the difference between tramadol and toradol. And I am not putting off a non-routine cancer screening over a leg.
