"When I had my surgery I felt the same. This fear of what *could be*. I had to change my way of thinking. So what if it’s seminoma or non-seminoma? So what if you have to go through further things like chemo or radiation? Is stressing about it going to make a difference? Absolutely not. Will anything you do or have done make a difference? Absolutely not. You can’t go back in time and go to the doctor sooner, so don’t even think about that anymore. What’s done is done. All you can do is keep your head up and push forward. Take on whatever challenge you are faced with. 

You’re alive and healthy. You have a wife and a baby on the way. Plenty to be grateful for. 

Fuck cancer man. It’s fucking bullshit. But, shit like that happens. Thankfully TC is super treatable and the cure rate is astronomically high. Regardless of what transpires, things will be just fine. 

Some people may find what I say crude or tough love. But sometimes love needs to be tough. Life isn’t rainbows and sunshine all the time. Things are allowed to suck. How you persevere and push on defines who you are as a human being.

"I did IV, no port. I used ice bags on my hands and feet. I could only use my right arm for IV due to the mastectomy. I walked around or sat in my chair. I think sessions were 2-3 hours, not 4-6. One vein is shot. Otherwise, all is well. It's doable. If you don't trust your team, you should wait on treatment. Honestly, you need to trust your team. Cancer is a huge emotional roller coaster and you don't need the stress of second guessing your team. Hope my experience brings you some relief that a port is not always necessary.

He's not someone like a son to me but man did this really relate to me... everything you mentioned to the cancer spreading to the low blood levels to his organs failing... my cousin went through all of that, and now he's made his decision. It spread to his brain and came back even though he fought it once already. I told him what was probably my final goodbye today.

"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it. 

I don't know if anything I said was really helpful, but I hope it was. I'm sending you and your wife a ton of love right now and hoping this particular issue will become less important as she heals from the surgery and the pain subsides.",0,1719808898,breastcancer

"from Google Ai

This report dives deep into the analysis of a lymph node biopsy from your right neck using a technique called flow cytometry. Here's a breakdown with more details and a cautious approach to interpreting the results:

The Bad News (Potential):

The presence of an abnormal cell population expressing CD30 is a red flag. CD30 is a protein marker often associated with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system.
Increased Forward Scatter and Side Scatter suggest the cells are larger and more granular, another characteristic sometimes seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.
The Not-So-Bad News (Uncertainties):

The report emphasizes the need for morphologic correlation. This means looking at the cells under a microscope to confirm their exact shape and size. Flow cytometry can provide clues, but a definitive diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma relies heavily on microscopic examination.
Some markers like CD15 (positive) and CD40 (positive) can be positive in Hodgkin lymphoma, but they're not exclusive. Other types of lymphomas can also express them.
Markers like CD20 (weakly positive) and CD5 (variable) are typically negative in Hodgkin lymphoma, but the results here might be due to technical issues.
Overall:

This report raises a suspicion of Hodgkin lymphoma, but it's not conclusive. It's crucial to have the tissue sample examined by a pathologist under a microscope (morphologic correlation) for a definitive diagnosis.

Here's what likely happens next:

Your doctor will discuss these results with you and likely recommend further testing, including a lymph node biopsy analysis under a microscope.
Depending on the final diagnosis, they'll outline the next steps, which could involve additional tests, scans, or treatment options.
Important Note:

This explanation is for informational purposes only and should not be a cause for alarm.  I cannot interpret medical results definitively.  Please consult with your doctor to understand the full picture of your situation and the recommended course of action.

"I had my abdormal pap about a month before my colposcopy/biopsy. Then my procedure was originally scheduled a month or two away, but they ended up moving it up after they saw how upset/anxious I was about it. Overall you will probably have more than a month before your procedure. My doctor wasn't in a huge rush, but did state it needed to be treated soon. I have heard of people going much longer before treating theirs. Even if you are able to get the procedure sooner, I would wait until after your wedding. I would not have wanted to be recovering anywhere at home, especially while trying to celebrate my wedding. You will definitely have time to recover between your wedding and your graduation. Get your procedure scheduled after your wedding so you don't need to stress about that part and let yourself enjoy your wedding. 

Cervical cancer can take over a decade to develop. I had a clear pap 2 years ago and was scared of cancer because of how fast it developed to CIN 3. My doctor told me that the colposcopy/biopsy can also pick up cancer cells if they are present. You are most likely just CIN 3 and treatable. The next procedure can tell you more definitely, but since no malignancy was noted on the pathology report, that's a good sign!

For reference, I had CIN 3 all over the transformation zone. I had 3 biopsied spots around my cervix that came back as CIN 3 as well as my ECC. I had one spot of CIN 2. I ended up having a cone procedure because the CIN 3 in the ECC and also to get a better sample to ensure good margins. Recovery has not been bad, but I am grateful I'm able to work remotely at home and lay on the couch. I'm 5 days post-op right now. I received my pathology report on Friday and haven't been able to talk to my doctor yet, but it did say no malignancy found in the cone in the report. (ECC did not have enough cells to test, which sucks) I know it's easier said than done, but try to wait until you talk to the doctor before you panic.",0,1719795113,PreCervicalCancer
"My doctor said they can tell from the biopsy sometimes if there are cancerous cells present. When mine was confirmed CIN 3 on the colposcopy biopsy, she was very clear that they did not find cancer, but it was the last step of precancer before cancer. Each procedure, is another possibility of finding cancer because it's a little more invasive each time. If they get clear margins on your next procedure, they would be able to tell for sure if there is any cancer present.",0,1719795287,PreCervicalCancer

"No it didn’t, I ate spicy foods and all and never felt anything. No clue I had any ulcers. After the ulcer became bloody, I vomited blood out and they did an endoscopy. Not sure how long the ulcer had been there for.  

I also eat pretty healthy too, I stay away from seed oils, any preservatives like nitrates, grow my own veg garden with organic soil, ate a lot of mints which are anti-inflammatory. A daily matcha drink with adaptogenic mushroom extracts and raw honey, matcha powder. I also drank a superfoods smoothie 2-3x a week, I blended my own bc it has like 15 of the healthiest things you can eat, all things to reduce cancer risk. I figured doing all of that would really make my chances good, along with regular cardio exercise. Here I am, getting a diagnosis early in life. 

I’m talking to functional health experts and they believe I’m infected by parasites by my travels (eating street food and raw fish like sushi) and have SIBO, a bacterial overgrowth in my small intestine. So my immune function has been taxed. So even with all the healthy stuff thrown at it, the parasites had been depleting my nutrients, leaky gut syndrome. They do think bc I did all the healthy stuff, it may be the reason why it is not more advanced, the tumor is still small and no evidence is spread yet. They said if I get rid of the parasites, bacterial overgrowth, and restore acid function, then my immune system should be able to recognize cancer cells in the future and destroy them on my own. So I’m doing an integrative approach here. While going natural/holistic approach may save my stomach, it’s also a risk delaying treatment (surgery) and it metastasizing further. So it’s a tough choice but I’m believing in the process.",0,1719798745,stomachcancer
"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can’t find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

"Checking perplexity.io for the term: ""Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal"" 

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal extension refers to a specific pathological finding in prostate cancer where the cancer cells have spread beyond the confines of a lymph node capsule. This finding is significant in the staging and prognosis of prostate cancer. Extranodal extension, also known as extracapsular extension, occurs when cancer cells breach the outer layer (capsule) of a lymph node and extend into the surrounding tissue. When this extension is described as ""focal,"" it indicates that the spread beyond the lymph node is limited in extent rather than widespread. The presence of extranodal extension is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer. It typically indicates a more aggressive disease and is associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence and poorer overall outcomes. This finding often influences treatment decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive therapeutic approaches. In the context of prostate cancer staging, the presence of focal extranodal extension would likely categorize the disease as at least stage III, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. However, the exact staging would depend on other factors such as the number of positive lymph nodes and the presence of distant metastases. It's important to note that while focal extranodal extension is a concerning finding, it does not necessarily mean the cancer is incurable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the overall extent of the disease and other individual patient factors.",0,1719829305,ProstateCancer

It is not a death sentence. there is time.  While Gleason 9 is aggressive. I am still told I have 6 months or more to decide on a treatment plan. The goal to get cancer free is obtainable. I basically have 2 options as active surveillance is off the table. I can do surgery to have the prostate removed? or have radiation treatment to have the cancer cells killed.

"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",0,1719837665,cancer
"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

"Hi! I’m 45, ++-, ki 27( or around that) I was already in menopause when I was diagnosed with cancer. 

What was done with tumor? I had a bilateral mastectomy, my choice.  Cancer was found in right breast, but I wanted to feel as balanced as possible.  They did find cancer cells in left as well, so thank god I did both. 

Here is what I know- that’s a fairly high ki score.  Your cancer was hormone fed, our body produces hormones in our ovaries and adrenal glands. Your body producing hormones is like throwing cheeseburgers at cancer- it can feed it. The purpose of the hormone blockers is to reduce the chance of it coming back.  Breast cancer can return to breasts or bone.

I don’t know a lot about pcos but I believe It is also an imbalance of hormones.  You may benefit.  

I will be honest I hate the hormone blockers.  We are trying a 3rd one now to see if it is any better.  I get horrible pain from them.  Estrogen is important in our bodies, but you have to decide which is more important. 

No estrogen means, aging skin( I don’t feel my hair quality has changed, I am gray but that was happening before chemo, now I just embrace it), joint pain, pain with sex( I could write a whole book on that) BUT it also helps keep cancer away…..

"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

"Completely understand as my niece fought osteosarcoma from the age of 6-12years (yes, it’s a different cancer). And while medical bills pile high, there is help out there. Multiple people and organizations (I work for one who offered her family support) have offered Sam help in ways other than money (lodging, food delivery, gift cards to Target, etc) and I know firsthand she finds a way to say she prefers money because everything else is covered. As far as masks, any pediatrician will tell you that if your medically fragile child is exposed to others, especially children, (Jax and Summer go to school and we know how fast those germs spread) that a mask should be worn. A common cold could be deadly to someone like Delilah. Sam is hopeful, like any parent, that their child will get better. I don’t think it’s delusional for her to hold on to her baby because I sure would, so no judgment there. For me, it’s the constant asking that is off putting. If you research her GoFund Me accounts from the beginning of Delilah’s battle, one campaign alone got over $127K. Then they closed it and immediately started a new one. They absolutely deserve all the money to try and save Delilah and to go on family trips when Delilah is feeling up to it, but I do think Sam takes advantage to some degree.",0,1719813554,Fuckcancer
"I'll go to the ER at literally the first sign of infection. I'm well versed in regular wound care and infection. But the simple fact is that I do not have the option to see a physician sooner than Monday the 8^(th), and this is not something I trust to some rando PA. Last time I was in an urgent care with a PA, the dude didn't know the difference between tramadol and toradol. And I am not putting off a non-routine cancer screening over a leg.

"She could possibly be suffering from Anemia... FYI if you are not familiar with this disease already.
Anemia is a condition that occurs when the body doesn't produce enough healthy red blood cells or the red blood cells don't function properly. This prevents the body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood, which can lead to a number of symptoms:
Fatigue: Feeling weak or tired
Shortness of breath: Difficulty breathing
Dizziness: Feeling lightheaded
Headaches: Pain in the head
Irregular heartbeat: A fast or abnormal heart rate Other symptoms include:
Difficulty concentrating
Irritability
Loss of appetite
Numbness and tingling in the hands and feet
Pale skin
Cold extremities 
Mild anemia or anemia that develops slowly may not have any symptoms. However, if left unchecked, anemia can become serious and feel like a heart attack. A blood test can measure hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell levels to determine if anemia is present. 
Risk factors for anemia include:
Poor diet, Intestinal disorders, Chronic diseases, Infections, Menstruation or pregnancy, Chronic medical conditions, Age, Autoimmune diseases, Kidney disease, and Cancer. 
The most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which can be caused by blood loss, poor iron absorption, pregnancy, or gastric bypass surgery. Treatments for anemia vary depending on the type of anemia, but may include medication, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, surgery, painkillers, supplements, or oxygen therapy.

"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

I wish you continued success on your journey, I'm genuinely happy to hear of your resilience and triumph thus far.",0,1719847712,cll
"I completely understand what you are saying.

So, let me say that I understand your argument and your concerns. 

Why do I understand?

Well, my dad did exactly as the doctors recommended. He had prostate cancer. 

Now, he is dead. 

I’ll repeat this. You’re concerns an entirely valid. 

You’re going to have to break out of your usual way of thinking, right?

The doctors are telling you to eat a low residue diet. 

Do that. 

Follow their recommendations to the letter!

Then, supplement.

Now, most people research and find pills to swallow.

"I, 23M, went through one two months ago, and to add to it I went out to cheer up, got food poisoning and the doctors mistook it for signs of colon cancer, did a colonoscopy, took a biopsy, and at that point I just said ok im dead. 

It was just food poisoning with an infection that escalated, and that’s just life.

In my gap year…

I applied to 4 jobs - all want experience. 

I opened a business - failed due to a dying market. 
studied for my dat, and then postponed it to save up more money for the test and apps that I could barely afford. And now I’m reviewing again because I forgot a lot of it. I still have the DAT to take this month. 

My hobbies? Hobbies are just making money.

Friends? I don’t talk to most of my friends cause I avoid “how are your applications going” “did you take the DAT” “wow, just don’t be lazy”. I homestead a party yesterday and they commented “so you’re not taking your test this year”, I kicked them out but they took it as a joke.

BUT, I’ve come to realize this is all apart of the journey. Every dental/med student goes through the same steps to reach dental school. That’s not on us, it’s on the US system. Other countries have their students graduating dental school at 23/24. ITS A 5 YEAR PROGRAM!

So yes. We are unproductive and not on full speed like others but when we do accelerate, we’re gonna be flying past them (with love) like a McLaren and a Prius. What you’re feeling is normal and you’re actually on a better route than a lot of other people. And enjoy your life, go on a hike, go to the beach, flex in the mirror lol. Life is full of stuff for us to enjoy and we just need to enjoy it.

Also, just live at home. We all do. Rents are crazy insane and nothing is gonna compare to ur parent’s home. If it feels better, pay a little rent to help with the bills.",0,1719848566,predental
"I’ll give you my experience with prednisone during my last 2 flare-ups, and some other experiences. 

I loved it at first. Was on 60mg a day for roughly a month, then dropped to 40mg, and began tapering off at 5mg each week for 2 months. 

I was naturally very skinny. 5’9, 135lbs. On prednisone I blew up to 175ish. Got moonface. I enjoyed the weight gain personally. It’s a lot of water weight and you will shed most of it. I stay around 155-160 now. 


The downsides… my vision went to shit. Now wear glasses. I’m not sure how big of a correlation my 2 flare-ups had with my vision going bad, but I did notice a degrade with it during and after my prednisone windows. 

Insomnia. It will be a pain getting to sleep during the first couple of weeks, but I adjusted. 

The worst part for me was the joint pain. It started about a month 1/2 on my first cycle. Absolutely terrible. I’d wake up with awful pain in every. single. joint. From fingertips down. My 2nd cycle I didn’t have it anywhere near as bad, but boy was the first awful. 

Appetite. Mine increased by about 300%. Example; would eat like 3 pieces of pizza from Dominos, to being able to eat an entire pizza + more in a sitting. I remember first seeing stretch marks around my cheeks/groin area and being like “wtf!”  So be ready to buy some fitting clothes if you gain a lot. 


I just had a colonoscopy last week, and everything was clear this go around. I’ve had 4 in the past 6-7 years. My last big flare up hospitalized me for a few days. Entire colon was covered. However, I was not on any preventatives at the time due to insurance issues. For the past year I’ve been on mesalamine (pill), but am swapping to Humira very soon as I just got better insurance that covers it.


Depending on how bad your case is (sometimes it seems like it’s worse than it is), your flareups won’t last long at all. You could stop bleeding/shitting 30x a day within a week on prednisone. I was diagnosed with IBS-D when I was around 15. It wasn’t until I had my first big flare at 30 they diagnosed me with UC. That was 8 years ago, and in the gap from then to now  I’ve had 1 major flare-up, and one small on that was starting up but I was able to tackle it quickly before it progressed. 


Diet wise, nothing I’ve found that I consume has caused any flare-ups. I eat whatever I want. I eat tons of spicy foods too. What I’ve noticed will throw me into a flare-up, is taking a shitload of ibuprofen for a week or two straight. I had some dental issues where I was taking 800mg x2 daily for about 2 weeks. Noticed some blood in the stool and immediately got ahold of my GI. Did stool and other lab work and started a 30mg prednisone routine and culled it before it took off. I was warned beforehand about NSAIDs & UC, but it was what I had at the time to deal with dental pain. 

Also, stress. I believe that attributed to my major flare-up a couple of years ago, and have been told/read it can be a factor. Try to do what you can to manage it. 

Try not to dwell too much on it. It absolutely sucks right now, and you’re going to overthink a lot of it (before I was diagnosed I got myself worried I had colon cancer). It’s super manageable though, and this could be the only flare you ever get. I know it sucks running to the bathroom so many times a day so your butt can sneeze out some blood & mucus, but the steroids will help. 


Talk to your doctor about preventatives. Here in the US we’ve got a few options. The ones I’m familiar with are Mesalamine (4x pills a day - I hated it), Humira (weekly/bi-weekly @home shot), Remicade (every 8 weeks, it reminds me of dialysis, maybe someone on it can give you more info).",0,1719848993,UlcerativeColitis
"Everybody talks about Ozempic’s potential positive effects, not enough people are warning each other about the potential negative side effects, that also happen to be common, and in some cases life threatening.

Bowel obstruction, cancer development, pancreatitis, kidney failure, gallstones, etc.

I don’t hate fat people, I was one myself once. Recommending Ozempic as a weight loss solution for people who aren’t morbidly obese or diabetic though, is as risky as recommending that a skinny person that has trouble gaining mass take steroids if they want to build muscle. There are legitimate medical uses for anabolic steroids, but that ain’t one of ‘em.",0,1719849026,Health
"What happened to me is the endometrial was diagnosed first, low grade stage 1a, so they told me to keep ovaries since I was not in menopause. Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now. I do have lung nodules, but they are not believed to be metastatic. It's really all a guessing game of anxiety, isn't it.",0,1719849610,endometrialcancer
">SUV can be elevated for natural reasons such as inflammation, and where your mass is located there’ll be a lot of that as the cancerous cells die thanks to the R-CHOP.

Thank you for this information! This sounds reassuring. My oncologist is also not really concerned about the elevated SUV for now and has decided to complete the 6 rounds of RCHOP. We will have to wait and see, so I'm just hoping for the best outcome. 

>For context, my largest mass (abdominal) had an SUV of 21 when I was diagnosed, and I’ve read here of SUVs as high as 42!

"Support from people I didn’t expect it from, which makes me rethink how I handle things when I hear someone else is going through a difficult situation.  I’m an introvert and always figure others are surrounded by others and they don’t really know me or need me.  At this point I realize that I need to respond (card, calls, meal, drop by to help) and let them define their level of need—-I need to stop defining it by my own comfort levels. 
Weirdly, my most helpful support came from someone I barely knew personally. A teacher, who I had to inform about surgery/chemo, due to impact on classes. She was fully curious about it all, asked a million questions and gave me someone to talk to without complicating a relationship.
Unfortunately, my SO has done little more than occasionally ask if I need anything. And my brother hasn’t said/done anything. I’ve called him about other family issues and he’s never asked how I am. That hurts. 
I’m still in treatment but plan to look into some therapy to help settle all that has come unmoored by the cancer.
