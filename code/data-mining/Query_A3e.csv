"I had my abdormal pap about a month before my colposcopy/biopsy. Then my procedure was originally scheduled a month or two away, but they ended up moving it up after they saw how upset/anxious I was about it. Overall you will probably have more than a month before your procedure. My doctor wasn't in a huge rush, but did state it needed to be treated soon. I have heard of people going much longer before treating theirs. Even if you are able to get the procedure sooner, I would wait until after your wedding. I would not have wanted to be recovering anywhere at home, especially while trying to celebrate my wedding. You will definitely have time to recover between your wedding and your graduation. Get your procedure scheduled after your wedding so you don't need to stress about that part and let yourself enjoy your wedding. 

Cervical cancer can take over a decade to develop. I had a clear pap 2 years ago and was scared of cancer because of how fast it developed to CIN 3. My doctor told me that the colposcopy/biopsy can also pick up cancer cells if they are present. You are most likely just CIN 3 and treatable. The next procedure can tell you more definitely, but since no malignancy was noted on the pathology report, that's a good sign!

For reference, I had CIN 3 all over the transformation zone. I had 3 biopsied spots around my cervix that came back as CIN 3 as well as my ECC. I had one spot of CIN 2. I ended up having a cone procedure because the CIN 3 in the ECC and also to get a better sample to ensure good margins. Recovery has not been bad, but I am grateful I'm able to work remotely at home and lay on the couch. I'm 5 days post-op right now. I received my pathology report on Friday and haven't been able to talk to my doctor yet, but it did say no malignancy found in the cone in the report. (ECC did not have enough cells to test, which sucks) I know it's easier said than done, but try to wait until you talk to the doctor before you panic.",0,1719795113,PreCervicalCancer

"It sounds like you are doing fine. You had surgery which requires recovery. Don't worry about what you should do; take care of you. I suspect your weird head space is related to the surgery, possibly the anesthesia, and thinking about what comes next.

"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

I wish you continued success on your journey, I'm genuinely happy to hear of your resilience and triumph thus far.",0,1719847712,cll
"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but: It's not just America. Most people just don't research other countries' health problems to know otherwise. 

For example, the media continuously will swear the US has the highest obesity and cancer rates when that's not true. We're top 5 for both, but not number one, with many countries in the Western world's obesity rates skyrocketing (and even outside the western world). American food can't be blamed for that, especially since other countries swear their food is healthier. 

Microplastics is a global problem, with many countries in the East suffering worse because they're the countries that ""recycle"" most of our plastic. I truly don't think we'll ever fix that issue (at least in my lifetime). 

Diseases evolve and change. Of course we'll have diseases that didn't exist hundreds of years ago. Part of that is due to how we live now and others because humans weren't living nearly as long as we do now. That's not an accurate indicator of general issues. We no longer have the Bubonic plague pandemic because of advances in medicine.

People are blaming healthcare alone, but for prevention to actually be viable, you have to fix the financial disparities in the US/elsewhere. Telling someone to eat fruits and veggies when they live in an area with corner stores/liquor stores/no grocery stores is like talking to the wall. Or telling someone to shop whole food items on a minimum wage salary while having 2 kids is like falling on deaf ears.

Finally, some people don't listen/care. We know cigarettes cause cancer at this point, yet people still smoke and will smoke until they die. This is actually a postulation as to the prevalence of certain cancers in Europe (high tobacco use).",0,1719849279,nursing
"What happened to me is the endometrial was diagnosed first, low grade stage 1a, so they told me to keep ovaries since I was not in menopause. Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis. Nothing can be hundred percent certain, but the belief is it was already there, and had ovaries been taken, it would have been found in biopsy. Mine has a 30 percent chance of coming back now. I do have lung nodules, but they are not believed to be metastatic. It's really all a guessing game of anxiety, isn't it.",0,1719849610,endometrialcancer

Where I’m from, CTs are used for emergencies and avoided religiously for young people, especially women due to the radiation. After that CT, I’ve had very regular MRIs, I was also told it’s better to see tissue and cancers opposed to a CT.

I’m an introvert and always figure others are surrounded by others and they don’t really know me or need me.  At this point I realize that I need to respond (card, calls, meal, drop by to help) and let them define their level of need—-I need to stop defining it by my own comfort levels. 
Weirdly, my most helpful support came from someone I barely knew personally. A teacher, who I had to inform about surgery/chemo, due to impact on classes. She was fully curious about it all, asked a million questions and gave me someone to talk to without complicating a relationship.
Unfortunately, my SO has done little more than occasionally ask if I need anything. And my brother hasn’t said/done anything. I’ve called him about other family issues and he’s never asked how I am. That hurts.

Since I am the only person my father has, it has come with a lot of responsibility. I have been on autopilot for months, taking him to appointments, chemo, doing the grocery shopping, cleaning and cooking. Making memories was important to me since my father and daughter are close. We had ice cream parties, tea parties, watched funny movies, went for drives or just laid on his bed with him and told each other funny stories. Now that I have been given the prognosis of 2 weeks to a month and we are at the end, those memories will forever make me smile. I am glad I was able to leave my job and take care of my dad. I am glad he knows how loved he is and he feels cared about. I have already grieved him in many ways. He is not very aware now and the dementia has gotten bad. This has been the hardest step yet, but also there is a certain peace knowing he won’t be suffering for much longer. I hope you can make peace with it.

"I was diagnosed with widely invasive follicular thyroid cancer at 31F. 

These are so much easier said than done, but my best two pieces of advice --

1. Realize this stress will get you nowhere. If worrying could cure cancer, it'd be cured l. If you spend all this energy stressing out and it's a good outcome, what was the stress for? Nothing. I'd you spend all this energy stressing out and it's the (very unlikely) bad outcome, why did you waste your time with stress? Realize it's pointless.

2. Worry about what you can control, focus on what you can control. This is going to all appointments, being an informed patient, taking your medication, and taking good gentle care of yourself.

"This really doesn’t sound like lung cancer at all.  This sounds like you’re in a severe asthma exacerbation.


Symptoms of asthma are shortness of breath, nighttime cough/shortness of breath, needing to use albuterol frequently.


Albuterol is a bronchodilator and a rescue inhaler.  It can help open the airways but does little to treat the underlying inflammation in asthma.  If you’re using albuterol that frequently, you really need steroids and possibly a combination inhaler with a steroid/bronchodilator.


If you could get a sooner appointment with another doctor (such as in an urgent care), then they may be able to give you a prescription for steroids to help and other medications to help break this exacerbation.  ER as a last resort.",0,1719828367,AskDocs
"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",0,1719837665,cancer

As soon as that started we made sure to get him in to the doctor and then that is when we found out that he had bladder cancer. Thankfully, the tumor had not made its way into the muscles yet and they were able to remove it. He then did BCG therapy for awhile and now he is down to just getting checkups every 6 months. He was really lucky. Thank you for sharing your story and giving advice. Again I am really sorry about your dad and if I do see a colorful bird I will for sure think of your dad. Take care.",0,1719802146,BladderCancer
So interesting … those exact bras didn’t work well for me as I had some swelling that would not go away and after I ditched the tight support it resolved within a few days. Everyone is different I guess. And like you my healthy boob nipple is noticeably lower than my cancer boob … this was my major concern about wearing a t shirt with no bra but at this point I just don’t care.,0,1719802613,breastcancer
"You are not alone... I am a 22y/o and I had my surgery in January...now finding out I may have lung involvement after RAI... I thought I was done and things were starting to clear up but they're not. So much waiting and struggle. I've had the same experience as you with people saying I'm lucky to have had thyroid cancer as opposed to other cancers but they just don't get it. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and stressed and scared. Just because thyroid cancer has a good prognosis doesn't mean it's less hard to go through.

Everything has been fine with my medication but I still understand what you feel. For my situation, I feel the same frustration with not being able to move on with my life, but for me it's from this new possible lung spread. You're not alone. You are valid. You are strong.

"I did IV, no port. I used ice bags on my hands and feet. I could only use my right arm for IV due to the mastectomy. I walked around or sat in my chair. I think sessions were 2-3 hours, not 4-6. One vein is shot. Otherwise, all is well. It's doable. If you don't trust your team, you should wait on treatment. Honestly, you need to trust your team.

"Hi, my mom is the patient 
Quick history: 56F, dx Jan 2023 S4 colon cancer with Mets to ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and a spot on the lung. 20+ rounds of Avastin, 15 rounds of folfoxiri, and CRS+HIPEC in August 2023. Currently on monthly infusions of Avastin & Irinotecan. 

She’s had multiple kidney & heart issues since the start of this year & has also had unbearable lower back pain. The onc & pain management team tried variety of pain meds but the back ache persisted. The oncologist was wondering & I was spiraling about bone mets. Bone mets, btw, are not very common and are late stage. 

She had a pet scan in April 2024 & no bone Mets. The lower back pain is because of calcium deficiency, lack of movement, and ongoing medication. Pain meds & calcium supplements are managing it well. 

I can’t understand everything you’re going through, but can understand the spiral. I have diagnosable anxiety since her diagnosis & continued treatment. You have all my understanding & sympathy. You’re already dealing with a lot& anxiety is a super bitch. I try challenging my thoughts, journaling, and on days that neither helps, sit with them. It’s scary, but they dwindle after a bit.

"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time. Same with a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) or your state's equivalent- you can't join mid-year without a QLE--- and open enrollment doesn't start until November for a January 1 effective date.",0,1719804535,HealthInsurance

My son and mother called very rarely. My son sent one box of things for me.....but not anything else after that....My ex-husband, who I had been talking to nearly every day, either about our son or on support of his new business venture, literally said ""Why should I care. Why are you telling me"" and then once sent me a message saying I should come home (but i could not because it was total lockdown)...and then stopped talking to me altogether (and years after we had divorced, he moved in with my mother, son and myself. He even stayed living with my mother after my son and I moved elsewhere. So, it isn't like we had any issues with each other.). My youngest brother, who i also talked to every day, blocked me the day I found out--guess I was of no use).

"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it. 

I don't know if anything I said was really helpful, but I hope it was. I'm sending you and your wife a ton of love right now and hoping this particular issue will become less important as she heals from the surgery and the pain subsides.",0,1719808898,breastcancer
"I’m taking your questions in reverse order …

You can travel both with an osteomy pouch and an external bag.  In fact, even though I have a neobladder, I use a leg bag for long trips.  This makes it a lot easier to deal with delayed flights, finding a clean restroom, etc.

My tumor was not muscle invasive.  I was “lucky” - as removing my bladder and urethra removed all of my cancer.  Because of my age and gender, they also did a radical hysterectomy, but I don’t think your dad has to worry about that 🤣.

Neobladder vs urostomy is a very personal decision - it is not a better or worse answer, it is a ‘what works best for you’ answer. Because I also have scoliosis (a spinal condition) that makes it impossible to sleep on my back, a neobladder is best for me.  With a neobladder, I don’t have to worry about dislodging an external bag while sleeping on my side.  

For some, a pouch is the right answer - it is simple to use, you can wear it for several days, and the post surgery recovery is a lot faster.  Neobladder surgery takes a lot longer to recover from.  It is much more surgically invasive; you not only have to heal from that, you also have to ‘grow the pouch’.  This means that you gradually stretch the neobladder by making it hold a bit more urine - starting with 2 hours, then plus 10 minutes after a week or so, etc.   For me, this process took about 90 days to get to 3 hours.  I wet my pants several times.  

Your dad has to decide how he wants to manage his urinary needs post surgery.  Does he want to be chained to a clock - go pee every 3-4 hours, or risk wetting his pants (neobladder), but with the ability to side sleep or stomach sleep?  Or, does he want to be able to (kind of) forget about peeing until his bag is full - a few days?  But, he may need to confine his sleeping position to his back.

Lastly - older people of your dad’s generation (like me!) can find it difficult to seek mental help - counseling or therapy.  It is hard for us to believe that talking can assuage ones deep emotional pain.  But, ask your dad this - could it make him feel more scared than he already does?  

I hope the above helps you and your family. ♥️🧧🍀🤞",0,1719809252,BladderCancer
"Ty so much for your detailed replies and for explaining everything. I definitely felt a little blindsided by the ANA test. I went to my orthopedist for hand numbness/tingling in both hands (it has since resolved) and some finger stiffness. No swelling or redness ever but I was scared it could be RA or early RA. X-ray clear but I know it could be too early to see anything. I asked him to send me for the RA blood panel and he included the ANA. I felt totally blindsided by the results because I wasn’t even thinking it could be another autoimmune condition besides RA. Wrist discomfort then developed but it hasn’t limited my activities and I have no muscle weakness, no swelling and redness still.

Everything came back normal with my RF, anti-CCP, CBC, ESR and CRP. I even followed up with an anti-SSA SSB with my family Dr (I swear I had extreme dry eyes and mouth for a few days. I was trying to reason with myself that either my anxiety manifested physical symptoms or exacerbated them). All negative but now I am worried it could be lupus. I keep reading about wrist pain/hand pain.

Do you know if joint pain should be systemic and usually migrates to other joints (bottom half of my body) and not localized in my hands/wrists?

Freaking out until I see my family Dr this week. Debating whether I should ask for a dsdna antibodies test. I was lucky enough to make an appointment with a rheumatologist for the end of the month.

"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

After chemo I had a right breast mastectomy with 13 lymph nodes taken in addition to the whole axillary dissection. So! Now I can’t have any needles or BP taken on my right, and I have lymphedema now! Ugh.  So all this to say, if I had a port, maybe my veins wouldn’t have collapsed and maybe my chemos would’ve been a bit easier as opposed to the nightmare of having 17 different nurses trying to start a line every time with my paper thin veins. I used to be a great stick too. Now I have the worst needle anxiety because most of the time people can’t access the veins on my left side unless they are really really good with cancer patients or little kids.  If I need bloodwork done for anything now I call my sister and bff who are both nurse managers (different fields, MS and surgical ICU) because they themselves hired their team so I get their top notch phlebotomist, and because all my doctors are in the same network (Hackensack) they all have access to the portal.

"Honestly, don't expect your PCP to know much, if anything, about Lynch. Mine was under the impression that it was ""just a colon cancer thing"" and refused to text me after I learned it was in my family. Because I was old enough that ""It wouldn't change the screening recommendations anyway""

And that's where it sat for 5 years until I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. I pushed for testing again, and mentioned that Lynch was probably responsible, he told me I was wrong about Lynch! I was stunned. Asked him to look it up on UpToDate (basically a medical encyclopedia for medical people to access during work - I work at a hospital that uses it so I'm familiar with it) and he did, during our visit. Apologized and said he'd learn more about Lynch before our next visit.

I then talked with the husband of a friend of mine who does internal medicine in another state and he also didn't know anything about Lynch beyond its connection to colon cancer. 

Lynch is too niche for most PCP I think. Wish I had known that back in 2017 when he told me I didn't need to be tested. Might have avoided my cancer.

"Choosing not to have treatment is a valid choice. It’s an extreme choice with extreme consequences though, and I think it warrants thorough discussion. 

For a lot of people with stage four cancer, probably for most of us, we will never be cured. But we can be treated and we might be here for years. Cancer can be, but that doesn’t mean it’s untreatable. 

I know that small lung cancer is a particularly brutal type of cancer and I’m sure that is a factor in your decision.

My advice is to get a referral to a palliative care doctor that is associated with your cancer center or hospital. This is a doctor that focuses on quality of life and they can help you understand what your life could be like if you underwent treatment and the possible time you could get from treatment. And they should also be able to talk to you about what will happen if you choose not to have treatment and how your disease will progress. And what can be done to keep you comfortable during that time.

They could talk to you about what time would be like when you are receiving hospice care. What are your options and where will you receive care and who would your primary caretakers be? These are all things that you need to think about if you choose not to have treatment.

Talk to the people closest to you, the ones you think can handle this discussion because not everybody can.

"I feel like working in the medical field makes it all so easy to get worked up and panicky over increases in cancer and heart disease and environmental carcinogens (as well we should, I agree, since those are the problems at hand) that we totally overlook the sheer volume of children who died before the age of eight as recently as 100 years ago. Or the women who died giving birth. Or all the people, men, women, and children alike, who died of infections/illnesses that cheap, readily-available antibiotics can cure in 5-14 days nowadays. 

It’s easy to catastrophize when you’re faced with something what seems like all day every day. We all do it.

And I think it’s really important for one’s sanity, if anything, to remember that we’re really not doing that bad overall. Everything is a trade off. At least that’s how I see it. 

The US is kind of a special case in terms of environmental protections because what flies and what doesn’t environmentally is likely to be decided by a patchwork of states and not consistently by any sort of federal authority (true even before the repeal of Chevron, to an extent, though of course that decision will make things worse) and that makes it harder for everyone to get on the same page. Not to mention our healthcare system is spotty as hell and remains unaffordable for lots of Americans despite the ACA, depending on what state you’re actually in. And we NEED to fix that.
