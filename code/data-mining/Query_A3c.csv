I'm confused about your self-diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and how you truly know? Pain like you are experiencing is a well-known symptom of thrombophlebitis. Will be interesting to know the MRI results as yours would be a unique pancreatic cancer presentation.,0,1719812763,pancreaticcancer
"Ohmygosh you poor darling.

Bear in mind that your Mum may be feeling a lot of complex emotions right now.  Her mind will possibly change a few times, but she wants the right to reserve a dignified goodbye to the world.

She will be very concerned about being a burden to you.  Please, please get in touch with Cancer organisations to give you both the best advice and care.  

The hospital or doctors, or even your church can put you in touch with the right assistance.  Even Rotary, Freemason's or Lions Club might be helpful.  Don't be afraid to be frank and explain to them what you have written here about the circumstances.

For example, in my town in NSW, a church has small but nice accommodation, near a pretty park in a lovely suburb for end of life care, for people of their faith.

There's aspects of her care that will be specifically related to the cancer she's experiencing, as well. Again a Stomach Cancer specific organisation may help you to stock up on items she might need.",0,1719813592,CancerFamilySupport
"I'll go to the ER at literally the first sign of infection. I'm well versed in regular wound care and infection. But the simple fact is that I do not have the option to see a physician sooner than Monday the 8^(th), and this is not something I trust to some rando PA. Last time I was in an urgent care with a PA, the dude didn't know the difference between tramadol and toradol. And I am not putting off a non-routine cancer screening over a leg. An infection has a curative fix. Cut it off. There's no curative fix for fucking around and delaying a colon cancer dx.",0,1719819595,Lymphedema
"Hi misskimchigirl, 


Did your menstrual cycle return? I was diagnosed with Breast cancer in August 2019. They had put a loop for me and started me on Zoladex before chemo. Periods stopped. They also put the NovaT380 loop for me. I had my last tamoxifen in April 2023 and my last Zoladex injection in August 2023. Since then my periods have not returned. We have also been wanting to concieve so i went on the 19th June to remove my loop. 
Ultrasound showed my ovaries and womb is normal.

One vein is shot. Otherwise, all is well. It's doable. If you don't trust your team, you should wait on treatment. Honestly, you need to trust your team.

"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time. Same with a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) or your state's equivalent- you can't join mid-year without a QLE--- and open enrollment doesn't start until November for a January 1 effective date.",0,1719804535,HealthInsurance
"Today was cousin went through with the decision to pull the plug. He's not someone like a son to me but man did this really relate to me... everything you mentioned to the cancer spreading to the low blood levels to his organs failing... my cousin went through all of that, and now he's made his decision. It spread to his brain and came back even though he fought it once already. I told him what was probably my final goodbye today.

"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining. It has only been a couple days since it was put in, and it's a pretty intense experience to be awake in an O.R. while they insert it. 

I don't know if anything I said was really helpful, but I hope it was. I'm sending you and your wife a ton of love right now and hoping this particular issue will become less important as she heals from the surgery and the pain subsides.",0,1719808898,breastcancer

"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.  I live a very simple life focused around family, friends and experiences.  It’s beautiful!",0,1719841803,breastcancer

"I feel like working in the medical field makes it all so easy to get worked up and panicky over increases in cancer and heart disease and environmental carcinogens (as well we should, I agree, since those are the problems at hand) that we totally overlook the sheer volume of children who died before the age of eight as recently as 100 years ago. Or the women who died giving birth. Or all the people, men, women, and children alike, who died of infections/illnesses that cheap, readily-available antibiotics can cure in 5-14 days nowadays. 

It’s easy to catastrophize when you’re faced with something what seems like all day every day. We all do it. But what drives this thinking is that humans simply don’t have the life expectancy to put and keep things in the proper perspective that would let you truly see that “if it’s not one thing it’s another.” But it’s true. And I think it’s really important for one’s sanity, if anything, to remember that we’re really not doing that bad overall. Everything is a trade off. At least that’s how I see it. 

The US is kind of a special case in terms of environmental protections because what flies and what doesn’t environmentally is likely to be decided by a patchwork of states and not consistently by any sort of federal authority (true even before the repeal of Chevron, to an extent, though of course that decision will make things worse) and that makes it harder for everyone to get on the same page. Not to mention our healthcare system is spotty as hell and remains unaffordable for lots of Americans despite the ACA, depending on what state you’re actually in. And we NEED to fix that. 

But I’m still comforted by the fact that I’m more likely to die of (perhaps environmentally-caused) cancer in 25 years than of rabies in like 3 weeks, statistically.",0,1719844854,nursing

"Checking perplexity.io for the term: ""Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal"" 

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal extension refers to a specific pathological finding in prostate cancer where the cancer cells have spread beyond the confines of a lymph node capsule. This finding is significant in the staging and prognosis of prostate cancer. Extranodal extension, also known as extracapsular extension, occurs when cancer cells breach the outer layer (capsule) of a lymph node and extend into the surrounding tissue. When this extension is described as ""focal,"" it indicates that the spread beyond the lymph node is limited in extent rather than widespread. The presence of extranodal extension is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer. It typically indicates a more aggressive disease and is associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence and poorer overall outcomes. This finding often influences treatment decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive therapeutic approaches. In the context of prostate cancer staging, the presence of focal extranodal extension would likely categorize the disease as at least stage III, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. However, the exact staging would depend on other factors such as the number of positive lymph nodes and the presence of distant metastases. It's important to note that while focal extranodal extension is a concerning finding, it does not necessarily mean the cancer is incurable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the overall extent of the disease and other individual patient factors.",0,1719829305,ProstateCancer
"By no means am I a doctor & I don’t have children, so your symptoms may be related to that.  I had inverted nipple, along with hard, orange peeling skin, to side & a little underneath nipple.

"Thanks for your reply, and I agree, I appreciate you sharing part of your journey. Your experience is a positive and reassuring one.  I have my work cut out for me in convincing him to trust and have faith. 

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but: It's not just America. Most people just don't research other countries' health problems to know otherwise. 

For example, the media continuously will swear the US has the highest obesity and cancer rates when that's not true. We're top 5 for both, but not number one, with many countries in the Western world's obesity rates skyrocketing (and even outside the western world). American food can't be blamed for that, especially since other countries swear their food is healthier. 

Microplastics is a global problem, with many countries in the East suffering worse because they're the countries that ""recycle"" most of our plastic. I truly don't think we'll ever fix that issue (at least in my lifetime). 

Diseases evolve and change. Of course we'll have diseases that didn't exist hundreds of years ago. Part of that is due to how we live now and others because humans weren't living nearly as long as we do now. That's not an accurate indicator of general issues. We no longer have the Bubonic plague pandemic because of advances in medicine.

People are blaming healthcare alone, but for prevention to actually be viable, you have to fix the financial disparities in the US/elsewhere. Telling someone to eat fruits and veggies when they live in an area with corner stores/liquor stores/no grocery stores is like talking to the wall. Or telling someone to shop whole food items on a minimum wage salary while having 2 kids is like falling on deaf ears.

Finally, some people don't listen/care. We know cigarettes cause cancer at this point, yet people still smoke and will smoke until they die. This is actually a postulation as to the prevalence of certain cancers in Europe (high tobacco use).",0,1719849279,nursing
