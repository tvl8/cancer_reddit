### Does sentiment vary between cancer and non-cancer subreddits?

Two different types of sentiment analysis were performed on both the cancer and non-cancer subreddits. In this method, a pretrained SparkNLP pipeline in Azure ML was used to classify the comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

| sentiment_label | count_cancer | count_non_cancer |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| positive       | 5929         | 5715             |
| negative       | 4071         | 4285             |

1. Data Processing
Comments from cancer-related and non-cancer subreddits were queried using a job in Azure ML and saved as Parquet files in an Azure Blob container. In the job, a filter was used to include cancer subreddits in a Parquet file and exclude cancer subreddits in another Parquet file. In the non-cancer subreddit, the data was randomized before excluding the cancer subreddits.

2. Sentiment Analysis using SparkNLP
Using the Spark NLP analyze_sentiment pretrained pipeline, the comments were analyzed to classify their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. 

3. Weighted Scores
A custom function mapped sentiment labels to numerical scores (positive = 1, negative = -1, neutral = 0) to compute a weighted sentiment score for each comment.

4. Sentiment Labeling
Comments were labeled based on their weighted scores (positive, negative, or neutral).

5. Grouping and Aggregation
The data was grouped by sentiment labels, and counts were computed for cancer-related and non-cancer subreddits.

6. Statistical Testing
A Chi-square test was conducted to assess whether the differences in sentiment distribution between the two categories showed a difference in positive and negative sentiment in the cancer and non-cancer subreddits.

Results of Chi-square Test  
Chi-square statistic: 9.325853191514204  
P-value: 0.0022594309243996907  
Degrees of freedom: 1  
Expected frequencies: 
[[5822. 5822.]  
 [4178. 4178.]]  

To assess the difference between positive and negative sentiment in the cancer and non-cancer subreddits the odds ratio (OR) is calculated as:

$$Odds Ratio (OR) = \frac{(\text{Positive Cancer} / \text{Positive Non-Cancer})}{(\text{Negative Cancer} / \text{Negative Non-Cancer})}$$

$$OR = \frac{(5929/5715)}{(4071/4285)}$$

$$OR = \frac{(5929 \times 4285)}{(5715 \times 4071)}$$

$$OR = 1.065$$

$$\beta = ln(OR)$$

$$\beta = ln(1.065) = 0.063$$


The coefficient \beta indicates the log odds of cancer for the "positive" sentiment label relative to the "negative" sentiment label. A positive value of 0.063 suggests that there is a slight increase in "positive" sentiment in the cancer subreddits compared to the non-cancer subreddits.  

The p-value of 0.002 confirms a statistical significance. However, with the odds ratio, the positive sentiment is only slightly increased.  

Positive sentiment was higher in the cancer subreddit indicating the these groups may provide support and resiliency in the communities who use these subreddits. In comparison to the rest of Reddit (the non-cancer subreddits), users may look for look and discuss for more information about experience with treatment, logistics, and navigating a cancer diagnosis, fostering a space for encouragement and information.


## NRC-LEX

### Is there a difference in emotional sentiments between Cancer and Non-Cancer Subreddits?

To analyze the emotions in the Reddit Pushshift dataset, the NRC Emotion Lexicon was used. The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a type of sentiment analysis that calculates the negative, positive, and eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust). The annotations to determine emotions were manually done through crowdsourcing according to Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney.

| subreddit     | positive | negative | neutral | anger   | fear    | disgust | sadness | joy     | surprise | trust   |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| Cancer     | 0.202806 | 0.119079 | 0.0     | 0.037681 | 0.067383 | 0.033798 | 0.058226 | 0.044399 | 0.028933 | 0.119079 |
| Non-Cancer | 0.170739 | 0.096125 | 0.0     | 0.034273 | 0.041384 | 0.023316 | 0.034463 | 0.044963 | 0.024675 | 0.082917 |

In the NRC Lexicon Sentiment Analysis, positive and negative sentiment were both higher in the cancer subreddits compared to the non-cancer subreddits. These findings may indicate that users in the cancer subreddits have complicated sentiment toward cancer discussions. The analysis also showed higher trust, fear, sadness, and disgust. Trust is a particularly noteworthy finding, as it aligns with HINTS' broader goal of deepening our understanding of trust in cancer-related communication.

## TF-IDF

### What words are commonly used in the Cancer Subreddits?

Given the results of the sentiment analysis, the frequency of popular words in the cancer subreddit were assessed using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). This method was used to identify unique or prominent keywords. 

1. Data preparation

* Two separate datasets were loaded: one for cancer-related subreddits and another for non-cancer subreddits.
* The datasets were combined into a single DataFrame with an additional column specifying the source (cancer or non_cancer).
* Text content was preprocessed into a column for TF-IDF analysis.
 

2. TF-IDF VECTORIZATION

* The TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn was applied separately for cancer text data to compute TF-IDF scores for each word in the respective datasets.
* Common stop words were removed, and the top 20 keywords were extracted based on their aggregated TF-IDF scores across all documents.


3. AGGREGATION & RANKING

* Words were ranked in descending order of their total TF-IDF scores for the cancer dataset.
* Rankings allowed for the identification of keywords in the cancer dataset.




| Word         | TF-IDF       |
|--------------|--------------|
| time         | 604.333288   |
| removed      | 510.072719   |
| thank        | 508.752837   |
| information  | 491.421062   |
| doctor       | 480.772518   |
| people       | 467.593201   |
| work         | 443.772165   |
| patient      | 387.074392   |
| cancer       | 365.678933   |
| best         | 340.635342   |

![TF-IDF](plot-images/wordcloud.png)

In this word cloud we see words such as time, removed, thank, and information. Some of these words may be used in conversations to talk about cancer care and possibly gratitude from support groups in the Reddit forum.
